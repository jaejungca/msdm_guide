    "section": "5 SQL (Structured Query Language)",
    "text": "5 SQL (Structured Query Language)\n\n5.1 Introduction: The Role of SQL in Digital Marketing and Analytics\nIn today’s data-driven marketing landscape, the ability to access, understand, and analyze data directly is a defining skill for success. Among the many tools available, Structured Query Language (SQL) stands out as the universal language of data. SQL allows professionals to interact directly with databases — retrieving customer, campaign, and performance data that drive informed marketing decisions.\nWhile SQL originated as a technical tool for database administrators and data engineers, it has become indispensable across many digital marketing roles.\n\nDigital marketing analysts use SQL to extract and clean data from Google Analytics, CRM, and advertising platforms.\nMarketing data scientists rely on SQL to join and aggregate large datasets before modeling or visualization.\nDatabase marketing specialists use SQL to manage and segment customer lists for targeted campaigns.\nEven digital marketing managers increasingly benefit from understanding SQL to ask better questions and interpret analytics outputs more effectively.\n\nThe rise of cloud-based data warehouses like Google BigQuery, Snowflake, and Amazon Redshift has made SQL skills even more valuable. These platforms use SQL as their core query language, allowing marketers to explore millions of records quickly — from customer purchase behavior to campaign ROI — without needing advanced programming.\nThis study guide provides a structured approach to learning Standard SQL (ANSI-compliant), focusing on how it applies to marketing and digital analytics contexts. You will learn how to:\n\nQuery and manipulate marketing data efficiently.\nPerform audience segmentation and campaign performance analysis.\nCombine SQL with tools like R or Python for deeper insights.\nPrepare for data-driven roles such as Digital Marketing Analyst, Marketing Data Scientist, and Database Marketing Specialist.\n\nBy mastering SQL, digital marketers can go beyond dashboards and pre-built reports — they can uncover insights hidden in raw data, ask better questions, and make evidence-based decisions that drive measurable business outcomes.\n\n\n\n5.2 Google BigQuerry\nGoogle BigQuery is an excellent skill for digital marketing analytics and data science, especially if you are working with large-scale data (e.g., GA4 exports, ad platform data, CRM logs).

While these systems use SQL for querying, analysts and data scientists frequently prefer to analyze, visualize, and model data in R.\nThe ability to use SQL within R bridges these two worlds — combining the efficiency and scalability of SQL databases with the flexibility and analytical power of R. This integrated approach allows analysts to query large datasets directly from R without fully loading them into memory, transforming R into a front-end interface for high-performance, database-backed analytics.\n\n\n5.5.2 Who Should Consider This Approach\nThis method is particularly valuable for:\n\nMarketing analysts and data scientists who work with large datasets (ad impressions, web logs, customer transactions) that exceed local memory limits.\nDatabase marketing specialists who need to query and segment customer data efficiently while applying statistical or predictive models in R.\nResearchers or graduate students who want to practice SQL and database handling within an R-centric workflow.\nOrganizations that use R for analytics but store their data in relational systems like BigQuery, PostgreSQL, or DuckDB.\n\nIn short, anyone who uses R as their main analysis environment but needs to pull, join, or filter data from databases can benefit from learning SQL within R.\n\n\n5.5.3 Key Benefits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefit\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\nEfficiency and Scalability\nQuery only the data you need from large databases, saving time and system memory.\n\n\nSeamless Integration\nCombine SQL queries with R packages for visualization, modeling, or reporting (e.g., ggplot2, tidymodels, Quarto).\n\n\nFamiliar Syntax\nUse dplyr verbs (e.g., filter(), mutate(), summarize()) that automatically translate into SQL — no need to rewrite code.\n\n\nPerformance Optimization\nPackages like Arrow and DuckDB handle large datasets efficiently, even beyond RAM limits.\n\n\nReproducibility\nKeep SQL queries embedded within R scripts or notebooks for transparent, documented workflows.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5.4 Potential Limitations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitation\nMitigation or Consideration\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Setup Required\nRequires connection setup via DBI or odbc; most tutorials include examples.\n\n\nLearning Curve\nUnderstanding both R and SQL together can take time; start with simple queries and dbplyr.\n\n\nPerformance Depends on Backend\nQuery speed and efficiency depend on the underlying database (e.g., local SQLite vs. cloud BigQuery).\n\n\nLimited Write Operations\nThe R–SQL interface is optimized for reading and querying; heavy data writes or schema changes are better done directly in SQL clients.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5.5 When to Use SQL Within R\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario\nRecommended Approach\n\n\n\n\nNeed to analyze large marketing datasets stored remotely (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake)\nUse DBI + dbplyr to query within R\n\n\nWorking with Parquet or Arrow files locally\nUse {arrow} to read and query data efficiently\n\n\nBuilding automated marketing analytics workflows\nIntegrate SQL queries into R scripts or Shiny dashboards\n\n\nCombining SQL querying with modeling or visualization\nUse SQL within R for data extraction, then analyze in R\n\n\n\nUsing SQL within R empowers analysts to query big data and analyze results seamlessly in one environment. It reduces data transfer, improves reproducibility, and helps marketing professionals unlock insights from enterprise-level databases without switching tools.\nThe following resources will guide you through this workflow — from foundational database connections using DBI and dbplyr to advanced integrations with Arrow for high-performance analytics.\n\n\n\n5.5.6 Learning Resources\n\n“Using DBI with Arrow” (R‑DBI blog)\nThis tutorial walks through how DBI’s new Arrow-oriented generics work—such as dbReadTableArrow(), dbGetQueryArrow(), and more—and shows how to improve performance and type fidelity using Arrow streams instead of traditional data frames.\nYouTube+13R Database Interface+13CRAN+13Links to an external site.\nCRAN’s “Using DBI with Arrow” vignette\nOfficial documentation on DBI’s Arrow integration, complete with code examples using dbReadTableArrow(), dbGetQueryArrow(), dbBindArrow(), and chunk-based streaming results.\nCRANLinks to an external site.\nApache Arrow R Cookbook – “Manipulating Data – Tables”\nExplains how to use dplyr verbs directly on Arrow tables via arrow_table() and how lazy evaluation and efficient in-memory formats help when working with larger-than-memory data.\nYouTube+15Apache Arrow+15Apache Arrow+15Links to an external site.\nR for Data Science 2nd Edition – Chapter 22: Arrow\nShows how to use Apache Parquet files and the Arrow package in R, demonstrating how to manipulate them with familiar dplyr syntax and explaining performance features and partitioning.\nR for Data Science+1Links to an external site.\nR for Data Science 2nd Edition – Chapter 21: Databases\nA foundational walkthrough of DBI and dbplyr, teaching how to connect to databases, query using dplyr-style syntax, and how SQL translation under the hood works.\nApache Arrow+15R for Data Science+15YouTube+15Links to an external site.\nR‑Squared Academy – “Chapter 2: dbplyr”\nA step-by-step guide with code examples demonstrating how to connect to a database using DBI, copy data into it, and query it via tbl() from the dbplyr approach.\nR Squared AcademyLinks to an external site.\n\n\n\n5.5.7 YouTube Video Tutorials\n“Accessing SQL Databases in R: Three Approaches” – A clear and practical walkthrough of accessing SQL databases from R using DBI, dbplyr, and a direct SQL method.\nOther helpful videos:\n\nTidyX Episode 70: Databases with {dbplyr}\nA friendly intro to using dbplyr in real-world contexts (“Making friends with your database admin…”).

Marketers who can use generative AI to scale content while maintaining human brand standards are expected to command 20–40% higher salaries.\nThe Rise of “Fractional” Leadership: Small-to-mid-sized businesses are increasingly hiring Fractional CMOs—experienced strategists who work on a retainer basis. This creates a lucrative path for senior marketers to transition into high-paying consultancy roles.\nData Privacy & Ethics: As global privacy laws (like GDPR and CCPA) tighten, the demand for Data Ethicists and CRM Specialists who can navigate “cookieless” marketing will grow.\nHuman-Centric Branding: As AI-generated content floods the web, “human” skills like behavioral psychology, empathy-driven storytelling, and community building will become the ultimate competitive advantages."

A third group—marketing data roles—connects performance across channels, often “hidden” inside broader analyst titles or housed in data/tech teams, and ranges from reporting (analyst) to prediction (data scientist) to infrastructure (marketing engineer).\nOver time, many professionals move into Strategy & Leadership roles, where the work shifts from execution to planning, prioritization, and managing teams and budgets."

Conversely, the roles with the smallest market share (Marketing Engineer, CMO, Data Scientist) offer the highest compensation due to the specialized skills or level of responsibility required.\nThe Analytics Middle Ground: Marketing Data Analysts occupy a unique “sweet spot”—they have a very high job volume (over 160,000) while maintaining a competitive salary, making this one of the most stable and accessible paths for those with a technical leaning.\nEntry-Level Benchmarks: The Digital Marketing Coordinator role serves as the primary gateway into the industry, with the highest volume of junior-level postings but the lowest starting salary range.\nSpecialization Premium: Moving from a generalist Content Marketer (\\(61k-\\$74k\\)) into a more technical SEO Specialist or Email/CRM Specialist role generally provides a noticeable salary floor increase, even if the total job pool is smaller."

For example, modern SEO Specialists and PPC Specialists are now expected to know basic SQL or data visualization (Tableau/Looker) to keep up with the automated bidding environments of Google and Meta.\nThe Management Heavyweight: “Marketing Manager” remains the largest row because U.S. companies frequently use this as a “catch-all” title for anyone overseeing a small team or a full digital strategy.\nIn the U.S., while creative roles remain the most numerous, technical and analytical roles are expected to grow at more than double the average rate as companies shift toward AI-driven automation and data-heavy decision-making.\nThe Data Surge: Marketing Data Scientists have the highest projected growth at 22%. This is driven by the urgent need for companies to integrate AI and machine learning into their customer acquisition strategies.\nSpecialist Shortage: While SEO and PPC specialists represent a smaller total percentage of the workforce, they have a high volume of active openings (over 90,000 active U.S. listings for SEO alone), indicating a significant talent gap.\nThe SEO Resilience: Despite fears that AI search (like ChatGPT or Perplexity) would kill SEO, the role is projected to grow 13%. Companies are doubling down on technical SEO to ensure their brand is cited by these new AI engines.\nThe Strategic Shift: Product Marketing Managers (\\(12\\%\\)) are outgrowing general Marketing Managers (\\(7\\%\\)). In a crowded market, the ability to define a unique product “identity” is becoming more valuable than just running standard ad campaigns."

They are the most common data professionals in marketing because they translate complex campaign numbers into plain English for the managers.\nThe Data Scientist (2.9%): These are rarer and usually found in “Big Tech” (Google, Amazon, Netflix) or large E-commerce brands. They don’t just report on ads; they build the algorithms that decide which ad you see.\n\nWhile 2.9% looks small, it is important to remember that one Data Scientist often supports a team of 20+ Marketers. Their impact on the budget is massive, even if their headcount is lower.\n\nThe Marketing Engineer (1.4%): This is a highly specialized niche. They ensure that when a customer clicks an ad on their phone, that data “travels” correctly into the company’s CRM without getting lost."

    "section": "4.6 Key Financial Insights",
    "text": "4.6 Key Financial Insights\n\nThe “Technical Premium”: A Marketing Engineer or Data Scientist can earn 2x to 3x more than a Social Media Manager. This is because they use high-level technical stacks (Python, SQL, Cloud Infrastructure) to automate marketing at scale.\nThe Technical Ceiling: The top two roles after the CMO (Marketing Engineer and Marketing Data Scientist) are purely technical. This highlights that “knowing how the pipes work” (data infrastructure and predictive modeling) is currently the most valuable non-executive skill set in marketing.\nProduct Marketing vs. Channel Marketing: Notice that Product Marketing Managers earn significantly more than SEO or PPC specialists. This is because they are responsible for the entire strategy of a product’s success, rather than just managing one channel.\nManagement Jump:\n\nMoving from a “Specialist” (SEO/PPC) to a “Manager” (Digital Marketing Manager) typically results in a 25-30% salary increase as you shift from executing tasks to managing budgets and people.\nThere is a significant “gap” between the Marketing Manager level (~$100k) and the Director/CMO level ($160k+). This jump usually requires moving from managing campaigns to managing business P&L (Profit and Loss).\n\nThe Creative Paradox: Social Media and Content roles have the highest visibility and second-highest job volume, but they sit at the bottom of the salary table. This is largely because these roles are often perceived as having a lower barrier to entry, though high-level “Content Strategists” in specialized industries can certainly earn more than these averages.\nLocation & Industry: These averages are national. Roles in San Francisco, New York, or Seattle, especially within the Tech or Biotech industries, often pay 20-40% above the ranges listed here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSummary of Career Value\n\n\n\n\nIf you are looking for the best return on investment for your time, the Data & Analytics category (specifically Data Science and Engineering) offers the highest combination of salary and job security (growth).\nHowever, Strategy & Leadership roles remain the pinnacle of the career ladder for those who enjoy people management and high-level business vision."

The following recommendations apply throughout the entire project lifecycle—from Fall through Summer.\n\n1.1 How to Work with Your Group Members\n\n1.1.1 Use a Shared Cloud Folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteTake an action\n\n\n\n\nCreate a shared cloud folder (e.g., OneDrive or Google Drive) and grant edit access to all team members.\nCal Poly Pomona supports OneDrive, so it is the preferred cloud platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Meet Regularly\n\nHold a group meeting before your weekly meeting with your faculty lead to align internally.\nSince faculty meetings typically occur once a week, meeting as a group once a week is recommended.\nTo reduce scheduling challenges, consider using class time in CEP-hosting courses (IBM 6200, IBM 6800, IBM 6950) for group meetings.\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Use Student-Only Meetings Effectively\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipSmart Action\n\n\n\n\nDiscuss tasks to be completed.\nAssign responsibilities to team members.\nIdentify and refine questions to ask your faculty lead or client\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 How to Work with Your Faculty Lead\n\n1.2.1 Share Your Entire Project Folder\n\nShare your entire cloud project folder with your faculty lead—not just selected files—even if they have not explicitly requested access.\nThis enables efficient feedback and reduces unnecessary back-and-forth.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Ensure Transparency and Accountability\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\nCreate subfolders labeled with each team member’s name to document individual contributions.\nTransparency helps teams self-regulate contributions and reduces conflicts related to free-riding, which is common in group projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Meet Weekly—with Purpose\n\nTeams are expected to meet with their faculty lead once a week, unless there is no agenda for that week.\nIf you do not have topics to discuss, you may skip the meeting—but regular, purposeful meetings are essential for project success.\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Schedule Meetings Professionally\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nUse your email program’s calendar and scheduling features to organize meetings.\nAlways send a calendar invitation to all attendees.\nThis is standard professional practice and helps prevent missed meetings, double booking, and miscommunication.\nEffective use of scheduling tools reflects professionalism and respect for others’ time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 How to Work with Your Client\n\n1.3.1 Faculty–Client Joint Meetings\n\nIn most cases, inviting the client to your regular weekly meeting with your faculty lead is the most efficient approach.\nTreat these as joint meetings involving both faculty and client.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Meetings Without Faculty\n\nScheduling separate meetings with the client can be challenging if faculty are unavailable.\nIf you must meet with the client without your faculty lead present, update the faculty afterward with key takeaways and decisions.\n\n\n\n1.3.3 How Often Should You Meet with the Client?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\n\nClient meetings are typically less frequent than faculty meetings.\nInvite the client when your agenda includes questions or decisions that only the client can address, such as:\n\nCompany background or marketing strategy not publicly available\nInternal data required for the project\nAll major MSDM-required presentations (one in Fall, two in Spring, and two in Summer)\nRequests for approval, resources, or cooperation (e.g., executing a digital marketing plan)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4 Best Scheduling Practices\n\n1.4.1 Use a recurring calendar invite for weekly meetings.\n\n\n1.4.2 Include the meeting agenda in the calendar invite whenever possible.\n\n\n1.4.3 Manage Agendas Wisely for Recurring Meetings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantDetails\n\n\n\n\nIf you have already sent a long-term recurring invite, use one shared cloud document to store all future agendas.\nUpdate the document before each meeting so everyone arrives prepared.\nRecommended Tools\n\nIn Google Docs:\nUse tabs, with each tab labeled by meeting date.\nIn Microsoft Word:\nTurn on View → Navigation Pane and use heading styles (Title, Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.) to organize agendas hierarchically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.4 Exercise a Proper Rescheduling or Canceling a Meeting Incident\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n\nCancel or reschedule only the specific meeting instance, not the entire series.\nAlways notify all participants via the calendar system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5 Use a Project Management Tool\nTo plan activities, track milestones, and coordinate tasks effectively, use a project management tool that keeps everything in one place.\n\nIf your team already uses a tool, continue using it.\nIf not, Notion is highly recommended.\n\nFor a detailed comparison of project management tools and guidance on how to choose one, see Project Management Tools."

    "title": "MSDM Culminating Experience Project (aka Capstone Project)",
    "section": "3 How to Choose a Project",
    "text": "3 How to Choose a Project\nTo get the best out of MSDM Culminating Experience, consider multiple factors and make an informed decision.\n\n3.1 Nature of the Project (Basic research vs. Applied Research)\nConsider whether your project aims to generate new conceptual insights or solve a practical marketing problem. Basic research emphasizes theory-building, while applied research focuses on actionable solutions for real organizations. Choose the approach that best supports your learning goals and showcases your strengths. The two types differ the most in Chapter 2 and Chapter 5.\n\nFor basic research, Chapter 2 will primarily focus on the literature review and hypothesis development, while Chapter 5 will discuss implications for theory advancement and provide recommendations for marketing practitioners. For applied research, on the other hand, Chapter 2 will combine business-related information with a brief literature review, while Chapter 5 will focus on marketing plans, their implementation, evaluation of the implemented plans, and reflections.\n\n\n\n3.2 Characteristics of Project Sponsor (Faculty vs. Students)\nProjects led by faculty sponsors often provide structured guidance and defined expectations, while student-initiated projects allow greater autonomy and creativity. There will be faculty advisor assigned to the approved sudent-iniated projects, the faculty advisor may not have sufficient expertise. Thus, reflect on the level of support you prefer and the working style that helps you perform at your best. The sponsor’s expertise can also shape the project’s direction and rigor.\n\n\n3.3 Project’s Alignment with your Career Objective (Digital Marketing Strategy vs. Marketing Science)\nSelect a project that builds the competencies most relevant to your intended career path. Strategy-focused students may benefit from work involving planning, content creation, and campaign execution, while analytics-oriented students may prefer modeling, testing, and data-driven decision-making. The capstone should strengthen your portfolio in the direction you want to pursue.\n\n\n3.4 Availability of Data\nStrong projects rely on access to meaningful, timely, and sufficient data. Before committing, ensure that data can be obtained without legal, logistical, or ethical barriers. Reliable data availability will determine the project’s feasibility and depth of analysis. Availability of data will be more important for students with marketing analytics emphasis than digital marketing strategy emphasis.\n\nExisting data (secondary data) may come from the client company’s Google Analytics, Google Ads, sales, or CRM systems. If your objectives involve digital marketing planning and execution—typically conducted in late spring and summer—you should confirm the integrity of the data during the fall semester as part of your project proposal presentation. This process involves gaining access to the relevant data and digital marketing platforms and performing a comprehensive audit. Ensure that all metrics and variables proposed for the AOs are available.\n\n\n\n3.5 Type of Data: Primary data vs. Secondary Data\nPrimary data collection allows for customized insights but may require more time, planning, and resources. Secondary data—such as existing company datasets, public sources, or digital platforms—offers convenience and faster analysis. Select the data type that fits your timeline, skills, and research objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningIs Seconday Data Better than Primary Data?\n\n\n\nNot necessarily. Each has its pros and cons. Primary data allows you to tailor the data collection process to your specific research questions, ensuring relevance and accuracy. However, it can be time-consuming and costly to gather. Secondary data is often more readily available and cost-effective, but it may not perfectly align with your research needs and could have limitations in terms of quality or completeness. Consider your project’s requirements, timeline, and resources when choosing between primary and secondary data.\nIf you are dealing with secondary data, it is important that you have access to the data during the fall semester so that you can assess its suitability for your project. Furthermore, if you are collecting primary data, ensure that your data collection plan is feasible within the project timeline. You should have at a minimum a solid data collection plan by the end of the fall semester. The solid plan should include the data collection method, target population, sampling strategy, data collection instruments, IRB approval if human subjects are involved.\nKeep in mind that data must be ready at the onset of the spring semester for analysis, regardless of whether the data are primary or secondary.\n\n\n\n\n3.6 Sophistication of Data\nEvaluate the complexity of the dataset you will work with, including structure, volume, and required analytical techniques. Simpler datasets support descriptive or exploratory analysis, while more complex data allows for modeling, segmentation, or predictive insights. Choose a level of sophistication that challenges you without overwhelming your capacity. Students who want to have career in marketing analytics would benefit more by working with sophisticated data, while students pursuing a digital marketing strategy can be okay with less sophisticated data.\n\n\n3.7 Nature of Analytics Objective: Exploratory vs. Confirmatory\nExploratory projects focus on discovering patterns, while confirmatory projects test predefined assumptions, hypotheses, or models. Each requires different methods, skills, and planning. Identify which analytical approach fits your topic and aligns with your preferred style of inquiry. Basic research tends to be confirmatory, while applied research tends to be exploratory.\n\n\n3.8 Whether Objectives are Expressed as Project Objectives or Analytics Objectives\nClients often have expectations and deliverables that do not fully align with MSDM CEP requirements. Their analytics objectives could be businesses objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionProject Objectives (PO) vs. Analytics Objectives (AO)\n\n\n\nPOs are term used from business’s perspective and often include broader marketing or business outcomes—such as creating marketing content (e.g., designing a website or social media posts) or increasing conversions (e.g., customers, leads, sales). These are the goals of digital marketing activities from manager’s perspective.\nAOs, in contrast, are from researcher’s perspective and therefore must be directly tied to data, because analytics objectives guide the analysis you will present in the report.\n\n\nFor this reason, it is important for you to distinguish clearly between project objectives (PO) and analytics objectives (AO) from the onset of the CEP process. To learn more reasons for the distinction, please refer to the section titled Interest in the Project Objectives below.\n\n\n3.9 Interest in the Topic\nSelecting a topic that genuinely interests you will sustain your motivation over three semesters. Passion for the subject enhances creativity, persistence, and the quality of your final deliverables. Choose a topic that excites you and aligns with your curiosity.\n\n\n3.10 Interest in the Project Objectives\nBeyond the topic itself, consider whether the project’s goals energize you—whether it involves building a strategy, creating digital marketing contents, conducting deep analytics, or designing experiments. Project objectives (PO) are goals (business objectives or marketing objectives) expressed from the perspectives of the client company. Your engagement with the objectives will influence the depth and enthusiasm you bring to the work. A strong personal connection to the project’s purpose leads to stronger outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantDoes It Matter to Tell the Difference?\n\n\n\nYes, PO sounds more exciting and doesn’t hint you what will go under the hood, while AO sounds harder as it implies analytical needs and data analysis when the reality is that both involves the same data and analytical rigor as well as exciting marketing plans and activities. Thus, students who cannot tell the difference will not make an informed decisions that they may regret later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipHow to Tell if an objective is AO or PO\n\n\n\nLet’s suppose one of the objectives is stated as follows.\n\n“Design an effective website that will promote the new service and generate leads.”\n\nOne way to identify whether an objective is a PO or AO is to ask:\n\nIs there data associated with this objective?\nIs the same dataset used for other analytics objectives relevant here?\n\nIf the answer is no, you are likely dealing with a project objective, not an analytics objective.\nAnother way is to ask yourself what method (descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, predictive analytics) you would use to address the objective in Chapter 3 (Methods). Thus, you ask this question:\n\nIs there any statistical method required to design a website?\n\nThe answer is no—because designing a website is a project activity, not an analytics task. This means that you are dealing with PO, not AO.\n\n\nTo learn about how to convert PO to AO, please refer to the section titled How to Convert PO to AO below.\n\n\n3.11 Existence of Digital Marketing Planning and Implementation in the Project Objectives\nConsider whether the project provides opportunities to develop and execute a digital marketing plan, as this experience is central to the MSDM skillset—especially for students pursuing careers in digital marketing strategy or Content creator. Projects that involve strategic planning, channel selection, content development, and campaign implementation allow you to demonstrate both creative and analytical competencies. Choosing a project with clear digital execution components can strengthen your portfolio and better prepare you for real-world marketing roles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nHowever, the absence of marketing planning and implementation expectations is not a concern for students aiming to become marketing data scientists or analysts. For those paths, access to sophisticated data that supports modeling and the generation of actionable insights is sufficient. In such cases, not being able to follow through on recommendations with full campaign execution is not critically important."

    "text": "4 Fall Semester: Project Proposal\n\n4.1 Secure Feedback From Your Faculty Project Lead\nShare your written project report with your faculty lead even if it still needs improvement. They can give you preliminary feedback early on, giving you time to revise before the final submission for grading. Remember that your faculty lead’s assessment will influence the grade you receive for IBM 6200.\n\n\n4.2 Project Objectives (PO) vs. Analytics Objectives (AO)\nClients often have expectations and deliverables that do not fully align with MSDM CEP requirements. For this reason, it is important to distinguish clearly between project objectives (PO) and analytics objectives (AO).\nPOs often include broader marketing or business outcomes—such as creating marketing content (e.g., designing a website or social media posts) or increasing conversions (e.g., customers, leads, sales). These are the goals of digital marketing activities.\nAOs, in contrast, must be directly tied to data, because analytics objectives guide the analysis you will present in the report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipHow to Tell if Something is a Project Objective\n\n\n\nOne way to identify whether an objective is a PO or AO is to ask:\n\nIs there data associated with this objective?\nIs the same dataset used for other analytics objectives relevant here?\n\nIf the answer is no, you are likely dealing with a project objective, not an analytics objective.\nAnother way is to ask yourself what method (descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, predictive analytics) you would describe in Chapter 3 (Methods).\n\nFor example: Is there any statistical method required to design a website?\n\nThe answer is no—because designing a website is a project activity, not an analytics task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 How to Convert PO to AO\nWhen an objective is not related to data or methods, you will have little to write about in Chapter 4 (Analysis and Results). Therefore, you must translate marketing or business objectives into analytics objectives.\nA useful guiding question is:\n\nWhat information do I need, and where can I find it, in order to achieve the project objectives?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample: Website Design\n\n\n\nSuppose the PO is to design a website to engage potential clients and increase conversion rates. For the website to be effective, it must follow UX principles, conversion-centric design, and SEO best practices.\nTo evaluate performance, you can collect visitor behavior metrics from Google Analytics 4 (GA4), such as:\n\nbounce rate\nsession duration\nconversion rate\nnumber of visitors\n\nThese metrics allow you to identify the website’s strengths and weaknesses.\nOnce you know what data you need and where it comes from, you can determine which analytical methods to apply. The next question becomes:\n\nWhat should I do with the data to generate insights that will help improve website performance?\n\nYou may also have expectations about relationships among metrics.\nFor example:\n\nHigh bounce rate on landing pages → likely low conversion rate\n(a negative relationship)\n\nYou should also consider what counts as an acceptable bounce rate, session duration, or conversion rate. Comparing your metrics with industry benchmarks will help you identify areas for improvement.\n\n\nFollowing the logic shown in the example, you can lead to the following conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantConverting the PO to an AO\n\n\n\nPO1: Design a website to communicate results and engage potential client brands.\nAO1a: Explore ways in which the website can be optimized for potential customers.\n\n\nOf course, AO above could have been expressed in different ways.\n\nAO1b: Generate insights from the GA4 and Google Ads data for website optimization\nAO1c: Generate insights from the GA4 and Google Ads data to increase visitor engagement and conversions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionUsing the Best AO Statement\n\n\n\nConsider multiple options and settle with one that your team likes the best. A few criteria to consider are the clarity and concreteness of the statement.\nUsing these criteria, you may choose AO1C as your formal AO1.\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Data Collection for the Above AO\n\n4.4.1 Preparation: Owned Media\nTo address this AO, you need to collect KPIs through GA4. If no website exists, you must:\n\ncreate one,\nconnect it to GA4,\nlink Google Search Console to GA4, and\nuse UTM parameters to track email and social media traffic.\n\nIf this preparation has not been completed, it should be done as part of Chapter 3 (Methods). At a minimum, you should complete this as soon as possible so you have at least one month of accumulated GA4 data before the spring term begins.\nBe sure to describe your digital marketing infrastructure and data collection plans in Chapter 3.\n\n\n4.4.2 ETL Tools for GA4 and Google Ads Data\nDuring the winter, you should set up the necessary own media (website, social media, email, Google Ads) and connect them to GA4.\nOnce GA4 and Google Ads are operational, you will have data for spring analysis.\nDuring the spring, you can:\n\nuse GA4/Google Ads dashboards for descriptive statistics, or\nimport GA4/Google Ads data into Google BigQuery for greater data control, inferential analysis, and predictive modeling.\nInside BigQuery, you can also use Google Looker Studio for custom visualizations and Gemini AI for modeling. If you prefer working in R/RStudio, R can connect directly to BigQuery. Packages like bigrquery allow your dplyr syntax to be translated into SQL automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHow It Works\n\n\n\nbigrquery provides a database backend that dplyr can talk to using the dbplyr translation engine.\nYou never write SQL—dbplyr generates and sends the SQL for you.\nBelow is an illustration of codes.\nlibrary(bigrquery)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ncon &lt;- dbConnect(\n  bigquery(),\n  project = \"your-project-id\",\n  dataset = \"your_dataset\"\n)\n\ntbl(con, \"your_table\") %&gt;%\n  filter(bounce_rate &gt; 0.5) %&gt;% \n  group_by(device_category) %&gt;%\n  summarize(avg_session = mean(session_duration))\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Presentation Rehearsal\n\nThe CCIDM advisory board has generously offered to help you with your presentation. If you would like feedback, you may record your rehearsal and send it to me, and I will forward it to the board.\n\n\nThe board members are very busy, but they are eager to support you—presentation skills are essential in any organization. One board member is even looking to hire interns, so this could be a valuable opportunity."

    "text": "5 Winter Break Activities\nAfter completing the Fall semester, you may be wondering how best to use the Winter Break to prepare for the Spring semester. The answer depends on your project type, data availability, and the feedback you received during and after your project proposal presentation—whether that feedback was formal or informal, written or verbal.\nWhile Winter Break is not a formal instructional period, using it strategically can help you catch up with missed tasks and significantly reduce pressure during the Spring semester.\n\nImportant note: You are not expected to complete all of the activities below during Winter Break. The goal is to make meaningful progress where possible, not to treat the break as a full academic term.\n\n\n5.1 Suggested Activities During Winter Break\nBelow are recommended activities to consider, depending on your project’s status.\n\n5.1.1 Implement Feedback\n\nCarefully review feedback received during your project proposal presentation and subsequent discussions.\nRevise your project plan, objectives, scope, or methodology as needed.\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Set Up Platforms and Access\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantPreparation for Data Collection\n\n\n\n\nSet up required digital marketing platforms (e.g., Google Analytics, Google Ads) and confirm they are properly configured to collect data if you have not done so already.\n\nFor detailed discussion, refer to Preparation: Owned Media section.\n\nIf your client already uses these platforms:\n\nEnsure you have appropriate access\nVerify data integrity and historical availability of the secondary data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Collect Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not yet have finalized datasets, begin collecting data according to your approved project plan.\nEarly data collection helps identify issues before the Spring semester begins.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Prepare and Clean Data (Optional)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nIf datasets are already available, use the break to clean, preprocess, and organize your data.\nThis preparation will save substantial time once analysis begins.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.5 Continue Literature Review (if applicable)\nIf you have deficiencies identified on literature review, the winter break is a good time to catch up. Often times, literature review is a prerquisite for data collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningCatch Up\n\n\n\n\nReview relevant academic and industry literature to deepen your understanding of the problem context.\nRefine research questions, hypotheses, or analytical frameworks as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.6 Build Technical Skills\n\nStrengthen any technical skills required for your project, such as:\n\nGoogle Analytics\nGoogle Ads\nGoogle BigQuery\nR or Python\nSQL\n\nEven modest skill-building during the break can greatly improve efficiency in the Spring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipResources to Consider for Skill Development\n\n\n\n\nI also have virtual classroom offered by Data Camp for most tools you need for analytics. If you want to utilize the free certification courses, please contact me. Some MSDM students are in the program already. For more information refer to DataCamp Virtual Classroom.\nFor other resources, see the relevant sections of the Skills, Tools, and Courses Alignment page.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.7 Plan Ahead for Spring\n\nOutline a preliminary project timeline for the Spring semester.\nSet key milestones to ensure steady progress and avoid last-minute bottlenecks.\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Alignment with the Spring Semester (IBM 6800 / CEP)\nThe Spring semester—hosted in IBM 6800 (MSDM Capstone Experience Project)—moves quickly and assumes that teams are ready to make tangible progress early in the term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipBenefits\n\n\n\nAny preparatory work completed during Winter Break (e.g., feedback incorporation, data readiness, platform setup) will allow your team to:\n\nEngage more productively with your faculty lead\nMove faster into analysis and execution\nReduce time pressure later in the semester\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Looking Ahead\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nBy the first week of the Spring semester, teams should aim to:\n\nHave a revised and clarified project proposal\nSecure data\nBe ready to discuss next steps with their faculty lead\n\nEven partial progress in these areas will make a meaningful difference in your Spring capstone experience."

    "text": "4.1 Career Preparations for Marketing Analytics Career\nData science jobs tailored for marketing is different from regular data science jobs or business analytics. So, again, I consulted GPT 5. My MS in Digital Marketing students asked me if they will be ready for job market as marketing data scientist if they use R and don’t use Python. What advice would you give them?\n\n4.1.1 R is absolutely a marketable skill, but Python often gives an edge\n\nR strengths: It’s fantastic for statistics, econometrics, experimental design, marketing mix modeling, and survey data analysis—all things marketing analysts and data scientists need. Many marketing and social science–oriented companies (consultancies, CPG, ad-tech, agencies) rely on R.\nPython strengths: It dominates in machine learning engineering, AI, data pipelines, and production-level work. If the job involves deploying models at scale or working closely with engineers, Python is usually the standard.\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Employers care about the core skills\n\nKnowing how to design experiments, analyze consumer data, build predictive models, interpret insights, and communicate recommendations matters more than the specific tool.\nIf you can demonstrate strong knowledge in data wrangling, modeling, visualization, and storytelling, you’re employable—whether in R, Python, or even SQL + BI tools.\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Bridging R to the job market\n\nFor analytics-heavy roles (marketing research, econometrics, MMM, A/B testing, segmentation, customer insights): R is more than enough.\nFor ML/AI-heavy roles (recommendation systems, NLP on consumer text, computer vision for ad content): You’ll likely need Python.\n\n\n\n4.1.4 What I’d recommend to them\n\nGet excellent at R first. Become fluent in tidyverse, modeling packages, and reporting (e.g., RMarkdown/Shiny).\nPick up Python basics along the way (especially pandas, scikit-learn, maybe TensorFlow/PyTorch if they’re ambitious). Even if they’re not fluent, just showing “working knowledge” reduces employer concerns.\nAlways highlight transferable skills. Frame your résumé and interviews around what you can do with data (segmentation, predictive models, campaign optimization), not just which software you use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip👉 So the bottom line to students would be:\n\n\n\nYes, you can be job-ready with just R for many marketing analytics and data science roles. But if you want to maximize opportunities—especially in ML-heavy or tech-company contexts—adding at least some Python competency will make you more competitive."

(Visual Studio Marketplace;Visual Studio Code;GitHub.)\nHelpful bits:\n\nlanguageserver for IDE features (autocomplete, linting). (jozef.io)\nhttpgd for a great plot viewer (enable “R: Plot: Use httpgd”). Note: currently installed from GitHub. (Stack Overflow)\n\n\n\nQuarto\n\n\nInstall Quarto CLI, then VS Code “Quarto” extension for render/preview and project workflows (websites/books). (Quarto;Visual Studio Marketplace; GitHub)\n\n\nPython\n\n\nExtensions: Python, Pylance, and Jupyter (first-class support; active monthly releases; new dedicated Python Environments panel rolling out). (Visual Studio Marketplace; Microsoft for Developers+1; Visual Studio Magazine)\n\n\n\n4.6.2 Connecting to data warehouses (three good paths)\nA. Pure SQL inside VS Code\n\nUse SQLTools plus the driver for your warehouse (Snowflake, Databricks, Postgres, etc.) to browse schemas and run queries inline.

Microsoft LearnLinks to an external site.\n\nB. R + DBI/odbc from your code\n\nUse DBI with odbc (or backend-specific drivers like RPostgres, bigrquery) and optionally dbplyr to write dplyr that translates to SQL. dbi.r-dbi.orgLinks to an external site.odbc.r-dbi.orgLinks to an external site.GitHubLinks to an external site.\n\nC. Python from your code\n\nUse SQLAlchemy, pyodbc, snowflake-snowpark-python, or databricks-sql-connector within VS Code’s Python/Jupyter workflow (extensions above cover environments and notebooks). (General pattern supported by the Python/Jupyter extensions.) Visual Studio MarketplaceLinks to an external site.Microsoft for DevelopersLinks to an external site.\n\n\n\n4.6.3 VS Code vs. Positron vs. RStudio (for your use case)\n\nVS Code: Most mature polyglot environment today; deep SQL tooling; constant releases; huge extension ecosystem (including Quarto). Great when students mix R, Python, and warehouse SQL. Microsoft for DevelopersLinks to an external site.\nPositron: Promising R+Python IDE from Posit with data/variable explorer and SQL pane, but still maturing; some RStudio niceties aren’t fully there yet. If you need “ready today” for warehousing, VS Code wins on stability and breadth. (Context: Positron pages highlight active development and gaps vs RStudio.) QuartoLinks to an external site.\nRStudio: Still superb for R-first teaching (R Markdown/Quarto, tidyverse, Shiny) but not as strong for multi-language + warehouse dev as VS Code’s ecosystem.\n\n\n\n4.6.4 Quick-start checklist for your class\n\nInstall: VS Code, R, Python, Quarto CLI.\nExtensions: R, Quarto, Python, Jupyter, and SQLTools (+ your warehouse driver; e.g., Snowflake/Databricks/MSSQL). Visual Studio Marketplace+3Visual Studio Marketplace+3Visual Studio Marketplace+3Links to an external site.\nR packages: languageserver, DBI, odbc, dbplyr (and httpgd for plotting). odbc.r-dbi.orgLinks to an external site.dbi.r-dbi.orgLinks to an external site.\nTest project: a Quarto .qmd that runs a small SQL query (via SQLTools or DBI), then analyzes results in R and Python chunks. (There are public examples showing R+Python in one Quarto doc.) kgmuzungu.github.ioLinks to an external site.appsilon.comLinks to an external site.\n\n\n\n4.6.5 Bottom line\nIf Positron feels a bit early for you right now, VS Code is the best “bridge”: rock-solid for R + Quarto + Python and excellent for data-warehouse workflows via SQLTools/warehouse extensions or via DBI/odbc inside your code. It’s a great environment to standardize on for your cohort this year."

    "text": "5 Step 2: Know the Curriculum (Degree Emphasis) Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIt is important that you align your aspired job roles after graduation with the Degree Emphasis. To learn about career and job roles, refer to Typical Job Roles in Digital Marketing section of the Careers page and come back here to proceed.\n\n\n\n\n\nMS in Digital Marketing Program Curriculum\n\n\nFor the Curriculum Overview, you may visit the official web page for the curriculum, but the implication is that there are basically three curriculum options for you. Select the one that would be best match for your aspired career path. In Step 4, you will be provided with the factors to consider when choosing degree emphasis.\n\nThree Curriculum (Degree Emphasis) Options\n\nDigital Marketing Strategy (DMS) Emphasis\n\nThis emphasis is best suited for students who want to have a career in Content & Creative Roles, such as Content Writer/SEO Writer and Social Media Manager.\nFor Major Electives: Emphasis Recommended, choose all 10 units under DMS Emphasis: IBM 6100, IBM 6150, IBM 6250, and IBM 6300\nFor Major Electives: Emphasis Other, choose IBM 6450 and one more course from any other graduate-level IBM-prefix courses or GBA 5140.\n\nMarketing Analytics (MA) Emphasis\n\nThis emphasis is best suited for students who want to have a career in Marketing Data Specialist Roles such as Marketing Data Scientist, Marketing Engineer, and Marketing Data Analyst.\nFor Major Electives: Emphasis Recommended, choose all 10 units under MA Emphasis: IBM 6520, IBM 6530, IBM 6540, and IBM 6600\nFor Major Electives: Emphasis Other, choose IBM 6700 and one more course from any other graduate-level IBM-prefix courses or GBA 6520.\n\nBalanced/Customized\n\nThis track is best suited for students who want to have a career in various Technical & Performance Roles such as SEO Specialist, PPC Specialist, Email Marketing Specialist, Marketing data analyst, except for Marketing Data Scientist or Marketing Engineer, for which MA Emphasis will be a better fit.\nIf you want to be well-rounded so that you can be prepared for various digital marketing roles across content, performance, and analytics, balanced option will be ideal.\nThis option allows you to choose courses from both emphases to tailor to your career needs and your current set of skills and knowledge. For example, if you have been working as a social media coordinator for an organization and want to keep pursuing your career on Content and Creative Roles, you should have pretty good working knowledge about social media platforms and strategy. In that case, there is no reason to take IBM 6250 (Social Media Marketing); instead, you can take any other remaining electives (from MA Emphasis) to expand your skills and knowledge."

    "section": "7 Step 4: Consider These Factors When Choosing Degree Emphasis",
    "text": "7 Step 4: Consider These Factors When Choosing Degree Emphasis\nChoosing between Digital Marketing Strategy, Marketing Analytics, and Balanced/Mixed Option requires careful thought. Below are key factors to guide your decision.\n\n7.1 Post-Graduation Career Goal\nEntry to mid-level career jobs in Digital Marketing can be grouped under three big categories before they move into leadership roles. For details about the taxonomy, refer to Typical Job Roles in Digital Marketing.\n\nContent & Creative Roles\nTechncial & Performance Roles\nAnalytics (Marketing Data Specialist) Roles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipRecommendations\n\n\n\nBased on the immediate career goal right after graduation, my recommendation for Degree Emphasis would be different as follows:\n\nIf you prefer to take Content & Creative Roles, such as content writer/SEO writer, copy writer, social media manager, and graphics/visual designer –&gt; choose Digital Marketing Strategy Emphasis.\nIf you prefer to take Technical & Performance Roles, such as SEO Specialist, PPC Specialist, and Email Marketing Specialist –&gt; choose Balanced/Mixed Option.\nIf you prefer to take Analytics (Marketing Data Specialist) Roles, such as Marketing Data Analytist, Marketing Data Scientist, and Marketing Data Engineer –&gt; choose Marketing Analytics Emphasis.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2 Upward mobility\nMany students pursue a master’s degree to advance their careers.\n\nNote on career stage: Strategy and leadership roles are often mid-career+. Many MSDM graduates start in specialist roles (content, performance, or analytics) and move into strategy/leadership after building execution + measurement + cross-functional experience. The pathway for the students would be like this:\n\nEntry-level: Coordinator, Specialist, Analyst (Jr.)\nMid-level: Manager, Strategist, Senior Specialist/Analyst\nSenior: Lead, Director, Head of Growth/Marketing\n\n\nA common pattern is:\n\nStudents with digital marketing work experience often reach a ceiling due to limited analytics skills.\nHigher-level roles (e.g., Director, VP of Digital Marketing) generally require balanced knowledge of strategy and analytics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipRecommendations:\n\n\n\n\nIf you already have several years of digital marketing experience → Consider Marketing Analytics courses.\nIf you handle data but lack confidence in statistics or machine learning → Strengthen your Marketing Analytics foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3 Pay (ROI) Considerations\nSalaries in digital marketing vary by role type (creative vs. performance vs. analytics vs. strategy/leadership), location, and experience level. The figures below are U.S. national estimates shown as:\n\nBlended average = mean of ZipRecruiter + Glassdoor + Salary.com\nTypical range + top earners = ZipRecruiter 25th–75th percentile, plus 90th percentile (where available)\n\n\nTip for students: Use these as directional benchmarks, then check “in your area” estimates and real internship/job postings in your target city.\n\nBelow are the salary information as of January 6, 2026.\n\nContent & Creative Roles\n\nContent Writer / SEO Writer — Blended avg: ~$80K (ZipRecruiter $84,151; Glassdoor ~$84K; Salary.com $72,912).\nZipRecruiter typical $49K–$96.5K; top earners $186K.\nCopywriter — Blended avg: ~$79K (ZipRecruiter $76,412; Glassdoor $86,199; Salary.com $73,481).\nZipRecruiter typical $58K–$86.5K; top earners $121.5K.\nSocial Media Manager — Blended avg: ~$83K (ZipRecruiter $64,845; Glassdoor $71,474; Salary.com $112,750).\nZipRecruiter typical $47.5K–$76.5K; top earners $95.5K.\nNote: Salary.com’s figure is much higher here, which is why the blended average rises. (Not “wrong,” just a different data/model mix.) Salary.com\nGraphic Designer — Blended avg: ~$63K (ZipRecruiter $55,951; Glassdoor $63,801; Salary.com $69,387).\nZipRecruiter typical $41.5K–$65K; top earners $77.5K.\nVisual Designer (often UI/UX-leaning) — Blended avg: ~$91K (ZipRecruiter $97,173; Glassdoor $105,186; Salary.com $71,867).\nZipRecruiter typical $71.5K–$120.5K; top earners $160K.\n\nTechnical & Performance Roles\n\nSEO Specialist — Blended avg: ~$84K (ZipRecruiter $67,388; Glassdoor $85,944; Salary.com $99,062).\nZipRecruiter typical $53K–$75K; top earners $90K.\nPaid Search / PPC Specialist — Blended avg: ~$77K (ZipRecruiter Paid Search Specialist $56,423; Glassdoor Paid Search Specialist $82,605; Salary.com Paid Search Specialist $92,325).\nZipRecruiter typical $46K–$66K; top earners $77K.\nNote: looking at Paid Search / SEM titles across sources generally produces a higher (and often more realistic) benchmark than the narrower “PPC Specialist” label alone. Glassdoor\nEmail Marketing Specialist — Blended avg: ~$73K (ZipRecruiter $69,583; Glassdoor $76,107; Salary.com $72,172).\nZipRecruiter typical $54.5K–$78K; top earners $111K.\n(In job postings, PPC is also commonly labeled “Paid Search,” “SEM Specialist,” or “Performance Marketing.”)\n\nAnalytics Roles\n\nMarketing Data Analyst — Blended avg: ~$82K (ZipRecruiter $92,811; Glassdoor $82,855; Salary.com $71,188).\nZipRecruiter typical $72K–$112K; top earners $129.5K.\nMarketing Data Scientist — Blended avg: ~$137K (ZipRecruiter $165,018; Glassdoor $127,657; Salary.com Data Scientist $118,402 used as closest comparable national benchmark).\nZipRecruiter typical $133.5K–$170K; top earners $243K. ZipRecruiter\n\nNote: Salary.com’s page labeled exactly “Marketing Data Scientist” appears to map to a much lower pay band than what ZipRecruiter/Glassdoor show for the same title, so using Salary.com’s Data Scientist benchmark is usually closer to market reality for this role family.\n\nData Scientist (general) — Blended avg: ~$132K (ZipRecruiter $122,738; Glassdoor $153,566; Salary.com $118,402).\nZipRecruiter typical $98.5K–$136K; top earners $173K.\n\nStrategy & Leadership Roles (often mid-career+)\n\nDigital Marketing Manager — Blended avg: ~$111K (ZipRecruiter $87,719; Glassdoor $130,412; Salary.com $115,281).\nZipRecruiter typical $68.5K–$100K; top earners $122K.\nMarketing Manager — Blended avg: ~$104K (ZipRecruiter $83,488; Glassdoor $106,785; Salary.com $121,659).\nZipRecruiter typical $60K–$98K; top earners $125K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTips\n\n\n\nIf you’re aiming for the highest ROI (typically, higher pay), analytics roles are often the best path. In that case, consider choosing the Marketing Analytics emphasis.\n\n\n\n\n7.4 Job Prospects (Domestic vs. International Students)\n\n7.4.1 Domestic Students\nGenerally secure employment after completing the program, if flexible with pay.\n\n\n7.4.2 International Students\nFace different hiring realities:\n\nCompanies must demonstrate they cannot fill the job with a U.S. citizen to sponsor an H-1B Visa.\nU.S. candidates are plentiful in creative and implementation roles (social media, digital marketing execution).\nFewer U.S. candidates pursue STEM-related analytics roles, making international students more competitive in jobs in Analytics Roles and Technical & Performance Roles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipBottom line:\n\n\n\nIn general, international students seeking U.S. employment are often better off choosing the Marketing Analytics emphasis or the Balanced/Mixed option.\n\n\n\n\n7.4.3 Strategic Consideration\nYou are not required to follow the recommended elective lists exactly. Choose the courses that best strengthen your skills and make you a well-rounded professional. We support a customized curriculum within the allowed electives. This makes the Balanced/Mixed Option attractive."
