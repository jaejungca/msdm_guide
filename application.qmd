:::

### Where to Apply:

Submit all the application document at [**Cal State Apply**](https://www.calstate.edu/apply/graduate). Look for the MSDM Program under Cal Poly Pomona Extended University.

### What Should be in Personal Statement / Statement of Purpose? {#what-should-be-in-personal-statement-statement-of-purpose}

::: callout-tip
For **the Statement of Purpose (250–300 words)**, applicants should explain **why** they chose the MS in Digital Marketing program and **how** their educational and/or professional background has prepared them for graduate-level study. If they are **pivoting** from another field, they should briefly describe **what motivated the change** and any steps they have taken to explore digital marketing or marketing analytics (e.g., coursework, projects, certifications, internships, or work experience).

A strong statement also communicates **career direction and fit**: what area(s) of digital marketing or marketing analytics they are most interested in, what they hope to learn, and how the program connects to their short-term and long-term goals (Refer to [Target Digital Marketing Career Roles](#target-digital-marketing-career-roles) section). Applicants are encouraged to include **specific examples** that demonstrate curiosity, initiative, and impact—such as solving a problem with data, creating or evaluating a campaign, or using insights to guide decisions.

Finally, applicants should highlight what they will **contribute** to the program community, such as technical skills, creative strengths, leadership, collaboration, or unique perspectives shaped by their experiences.

Overall, we look for a **clear sense of purpose**, **strong program fit**, and **genuine passion** for a career in digital marketing and/or marketing analytics (i.e., Content & Creative Roles, Technical & Performance Roles, Marketing Data & Analytics Roles, Strategy & Leadership Roles).
:::

### How We Evaluate Applications:

::: {.callout-note title="Application Evaluation Principles"}
-   **Rolling review:** Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis, so earlier submissions may receive decisions sooner.

-   **Statement of purpose matters:** We take the statement of purpose (personal statement) seriously. Applicants with clear career goals and a strong rationale for pursuing the MSDM are viewed favorably.

-   **Holistic evaluation:** We review each application holistically, considering academic performance, professional experience, and evidence of commitment to your career goals. A weakness in one area can be **complemented** by strength in another.

-   **Program fit:** We also consider how well your career goals align with the program’s strengths in digital marketing strategy and marketing analytics.

## **Colleges & Program Overview**

> The **College of Business Administration** includes **200+ faculty** and **5,000+ students**, and is **AACSB-accredited** (a distinction held by a small percentage (\~6%) of business schools worldwide). The college includes six departments and **Singelyn Graduate School of Business**, and the MSDM program is housed in **International Business & Marketing**.
>
> The MSDM program was created through the **Center for Customer Insights and Digital Marketing**, and the program draws support from faculty across business and related areas (including Economics, CIS, and Hospitality Management for select courses).

### Why MSDM May show Under “Extended University” on *Cal State Apply* Website

> This program is offered in partnership with the **College of Professional and Global Education (CPGE)**, a university unit that supports enrollment and student services for self-support programs. CPGE helps deliver Cal Poly Pomona’s “learn-by-doing” approach to working professionals and adult learners while the academic program remains anchored in the College of Business Administration and aligns with **AACSB standards**.

## **Target Digital Marketing Career Roles** {#target-digital-marketing-career-roles}

> Digital marketing is a vast field where roles are typically categorized by the **channel** they manage (like social media or email) or the **level of strategy** involved. Here is a breakdown of typical jobs in digital marketing categorized by specialization and seniority.

### Content & Creative Roles

These roles focus on the "what"—the actual assets users see and interact with.

-   **Content Writer / SEO Writer:** Writes blog posts, articles, and website copy designed to rank on Google.

-   **Copywriter:** Focuses on "conversion" text—ads, landing pages, and email subject lines that get people to take action.

-   **Social Media Manager:** Handles a brand’s presence on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and LinkedIn. This includes posting, engagement, and community building.

-   **Graphic / Visual Designer:** Creates the visual identity for ads, social posts, and email templates.

::: callout-tip
## Career note for international students (general guidance):

These roles can be great careers, but **H-1B sponsorship is often less common** because many positions don’t consistently require a highly specialized degree and are more frequently offered by smaller teams or agencies.
:::

### Technical & Performance Roles

> These roles focus on the "how"—the data, algorithms, and paid spend that get the content in front of the right people.

-   **SEO Specialist:** Optimizes the technical aspects and keywords of a website to improve organic (unpaid) search rankings.

-   **PPC (Pay-Per-Click) Specialist:** Manages paid advertising budgets on Google Ads or Meta. They focus on ROI (Return on Investment).

-   **Email Marketing Specialist:** Designs and automates email campaigns, segments customer lists, and tracks open rates.

::: callout-note
## Career note for international students (general guidance):

Sponsorship likelihood varies a lot here. Roles that emphasize **analytics implementation, marketing technology, automation, and data (e.g., SQL, tagging, dashboards, experimentation)** tend to align better with H-1B patterns than roles that are primarily creative or campaign coordination.
:::

### Marketing Data & Analytics Roles

These roles focus on **measurement and decision-making**—turning marketing data into insights, forecasts, and recommendations.

-   **Marketing Analyst / Digital Marketing Analyst**: Analyzes performance across channels (web, paid media, email, social) to identify what’s working and where to improve. Uses **Excel, Google Analytics, and Tableau**. They are great at storytelling and explaining "what happened" to the marketing team

-   **Marketing Data Scientist**: Builds statistical or machine learning models for marketing (e.g., attribution, forecasting, customer segmentation, experimentation). Uses **Python, R, and SQL**. They build machine learning models to automate marketing decisions, such as "dynamic pricing" (like how Uber prices change during rain).

::: callout-important
## Career note for international students (general guidance):

These roles are **often the most H-1B-friendly** in digital marketing because they more clearly map to specialized, degree-linked skill sets (statistics, analytics, data science, computing), and because larger employers who sponsor are more likely to hire for these positions.
:::

### Strategy & Leadership Roles (often mid-career+)

As you move up the ladder, the focus shifts from "doing" to "planning." These are the jobs that are not likely to be within the reach right after you graduate unless you have already sufficient experience in other specialty jobs in Content & Creative Roles or Technology and Performance Roles.

-   **Digital Marketing Manager:** Oversees the entire digital strategy and manages a team of specialists.

-   **Growth Marketer:** A data-heavy role focused on the entire customer lifecycle—not just getting new customers, but keeping them.

-   **Product Marketing Manager:** Focuses specifically on how a single product is positioned and launched in the market.

-   **Chief Marketing Officer (CMO):** The highest executive level, responsible for the brand’s total marketing vision and budget.

## **Curriculum & Completion Roadmap Options**

### Expeced Student Learning Outcomes

By graduation, you’ll be able to:

-   Translate marketing problems into research questions or hypotheses

-   Apply consumer psychology and behavior concepts to real marketing problems

-   Build models and make **data-informed marketing recommendations**

-   Develop an effective digital marketing plan

-   Communicate clearly in writing and presentations

### Curriculum Options (34 units)

> While a [detailed description of the curriculum](curriculum_contract.qmd#curriculum-new-curriculum) can be found on a section of Onboarding Guide, here is a concise overview of the curriculum structure.

-   **Core required courses: 20 units**

-   **Electives: 14 units (3 Options):**

    You can choose electives from one of the following three options below to support your desired [**Digital Marketing Career Role**](#target-digital-marketing-career-roles):

    -   \(1\) **Digital Marketing Strategy** emphasis or

    -   \(2\) **Marketing Analytics** emphasis or

    -   \(3\) **Balanced/Customized** option (by taking a mix of courses from both emphases to tailor one's needs for target career roles and get the best of both worlds.)

-   [**Culminating Experience Project (Capstone / CEP)**](capstone_project.qmd)\
    The program includes a **multi-semester client project**. Student teams work with a faculty lead across three semesters:

    -   **Fall:** proposal and project plan

    -   **Spring:** data analysis and recommendations

    -   **Summer:** digital marketing plan implementation, results observation, and reflection

::: callout-tip
#### Recommendations for Curriculum Emphasis

Based on the immediate target career roles right after graduation, my recommendation for Degree Emphasis would be different as follows:

-   If you prefer to take **Content & Creative Roles,** such as content writer/SEO writer, copy writer, social media manager, and graphics/visual designer → choose **Digital Marketing Strategy Emphasis**.

-   If you prefer to take **Technical & Performance Roles**, such as SEO Specialist, PPC Specialist, and Email Marketing Specialist → choose **Balanced/Mixed Option**.

-   If you prefer to take **Analytics (Marketing Data Specialist) Roles**, such as Marketing Data Analyst, Marketing Data Scientist, and Marketing Data Engineer → choose **Marketing Analytics Emphasis**.
:::

### Completion Roadmaps

#### Fall Admission:

-   **2-Year Roadmap**\
    Typically about **6 units per semester** and is designed to be manageable for many working professionals.

-   **1-Year Roadmap**\
    A compressed, very intensive option that combines the first- and second-year load. This is best for students without a full-time job.

#### Spring Admission:

-   **2-Year Roadmap**\
    Typically about **6 units per semester** and is designed to be manageable for many working professionals.

-   **1.5-Year Roadmap**\
    A compressed, very intensive course work only for the fall semester. This is best for students without a full-time job.

## **Key Features & Tuition/Fee** {#key-features-cost}

### Three Curriculum Options:

-   \(1\) **Digital Marketing Strategy** emphasis or

-   \(2\) **Marketing Analytics** emphasis or

-   \(3\) **Balanced/Customized** option

### STEM designation (important for international students)

> The program is **STEM-designated**, which can be especially valuable for international students because it may extend post-graduation OPT eligibility (from 1 year to up to 3 years total).Program Type (onsite program, not online)

### Comletion Time

-   Fall admission: 1-year or 2-year

-   Spring admission: 1.5 years or 2-year

### Program Type: Onsite (not online)

This is an **onsite** program, not an online program; thus, you must be able to commute to be in the program.

### Class Modality/Time

-   **Class Modality**: We uses a **hybrid class modality** where up to **50% of class time may be virtual**. For example, in a 15-week semester, a course could meet 8 weeks in person and 7 weeks on Zoom. Most professors tend to alternate between in-person and online meetings every other week.

-   **Class time**: Classes are scheduled weekday evenings and/or Saturday mornings

    -   **\$30,150** for one-year completion

    -   **\$32,250** for two-year completion due to additional term fees

    Some courses include [**micro-internship experiences**](career_prep_digital_marketing_marketing_analytics.qmd#micro-internships) that involve working with a real client. In examples shared, students completed client-facing work, met weekly with the client, and received compensation while completing class projects.

::: {.callout-note title="Important Note for International Students Regarding CPT and Micro-Internships"}
When a **micro-internship** is required as part of a course, exceptions to CPT apply regarding timing for work authorization processes. This means that international students may be able to participate in micro-internships earlier than the standard 2-semester requirement for CPT eligibility, but they should consult with the program director and the international student office to understand the specific requirements and timelines for work authorization.
