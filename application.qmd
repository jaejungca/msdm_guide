### Where to Apply:

Submit all the application document at [**Cal State Apply**](https://www.calstate.edu/apply/graduate). Look for the MSDM Program under Cal Poly Pomona Extended University.

## **University Overview**

Cal Poly Pomona is located about **30 miles east of downtown Los Angeles**, in the city of Pomona. The university includes **nine colleges** and about **29,000 students**.

CPP is known for its polytechnic, **“learn by doing”** approach—combining theory with practical, hands-on learning. The university is also recognized for a strong combination of **quality and affordability**, along with a diverse student body and accessibility across Southern California.

## **College & Program Overview**

The **College of Business Administration** includes **200+ faculty** and **5,000+ students**, and the business programs are **AACSB-accredited** (a distinction held by a small percentage of business schools worldwide). The college includes six departments, and the MSDM program is housed in **International Business & Marketing**.

The MSDM program was created through the **Center for Customer Insights and Digital Marketing**, and the program draws support from faculty across business and related areas (including Economics, CIS, and Hospitality Management for select courses).

### Why your application may show “Extended University”

This program is offered in partnership with a university unit that supports **enrollment and tuition services**. The academic program itself is run through the College of Business Administration and aligns with AACSB standards. This structure exists because the program is **self-support** (not state-funded), and the partnership helps manage enrollment and outstanding student services.

## **Curriculum & Completion Roadmap Options**

### What you’ll learn (Student Learning Outcomes)

By graduation, you’ll be able to:

-   Translate marketing problems into research questions or hypotheses
-   Apply consumer psychology and behavior concepts to real marketing problems
-   Build models and make **data-informed marketing recommendations**
-   Develop an effective digital marketing plan
-   Communicate clearly in writing and presentations

### Program Structure (34 units)

-   **Core required courses: 20 units**
-   **Electives: 14 units (3 Options)**
    -   You can choose electives for either (1) **Digital Marketing Strategy** emphasis or (2) **Marketing Analytics** emphasis.
    -   Alternatively, you can choose a (3) **Balanced/Customized** option by taking a mix of courses from both emphases to tailor one's needs for target career roles and get the best of both worlds.
-   **Culminating Experience Project (Capstone / CEP)**\
    The program includes a **multi-semester client project**. Student teams work with a faculty lead across three semesters:
    -   **Fall:** proposal and project plan
    -   **Spring:** data analysis and recommendations
    -   **Summer:** digital marketing plan implementation, results observation, and reflection

### Completion Roadmaps

#### Fall Admission:

-   **2-Year Roadmap**\
    Typically about **6 units per semester** and is designed to be manageable for many working professionals.

-   **1-Year Roadmap**\
    A compressed, very intensive option that combines the first- and second-year load. This is best for students without a full-time job.

#### Spring Admission:

-   **2-Year Roadmap**\
    Typically about **6 units per semester** and is designed to be manageable for many working professionals.

-   **1.5-Year Roadmap**\
    A compressed, very intensive course work only for the fall semester. This is best for students without a full-time job.

## Target Digital Marketing Career Roles

Digital marketing is a vast field where roles are typically categorized by the **channel** they manage (like social media or email) or the **level of strategy** involved. Here is a breakdown of typical jobs in digital marketing categorized by specialization and seniority.

**1. Content & Creative Roles**

These roles focus on the "what"—the actual assets users see and interact with.

-   **Content Writer / SEO Writer:** Writes blog posts, articles, and website copy designed to rank on Google.

-   **Copywriter:** Focuses on "conversion" text—ads, landing pages, and email subject lines that get people to take action.

-   **Social Media Manager:** Handles a brand’s presence on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and LinkedIn. This includes posting, engagement, and community building.

-   **Graphic / Visual Designer:** Creates the visual identity for ads, social posts, and email templates.

::: callout-tip
## Career note for international students (general guidance):

These roles can be great careers, but **H-1B sponsorship is often less common** because many positions don’t consistently require a highly specialized degree and are more frequently offered by smaller teams or agencies.
:::

**2. Technical & Performance Roles**

These roles focus on the "how"—the data, algorithms, and paid spend that get the content in front of the right people.

-   **SEO Specialist:** Optimizes the technical aspects and keywords of a website to improve organic (unpaid) search rankings.

-   **PPC (Pay-Per-Click) Specialist:** Manages paid advertising budgets on Google Ads or Meta. They focus on ROI (Return on Investment).

-   **Email Marketing Specialist:** Designs and automates email campaigns, segments customer lists, and tracks open rates.

::: callout-note
## Career note for international students (general guidance):

Sponsorship likelihood varies a lot here. Roles that emphasize **analytics implementation, marketing technology, automation, and data (e.g., SQL, tagging, dashboards, experimentation)** tend to align better with H-1B patterns than roles that are primarily creative or campaign coordination.
:::

**3. Marketing Data Specialist Breakdown (U.S.)**

These roles focus on **measurement and decision-making**—turning marketing data into insights, forecasts, and recommendations.

-   **Marketing Analyst / Digital Marketing Analyst**: Analyzes performance across channels (web, paid media, email, social) to identify what’s working and where to improve. Uses **Excel, Google Analytics, and Tableau**. They are great at storytelling and explaining "what happened" to the marketing team
-   **Marketing Data Scientist**: Builds statistical or machine learning models for marketing (e.g., attribution, forecasting, customer segmentation, experimentation). Uses **Python, R, and SQL**. They build machine learning models to automate marketing decisions, such as "dynamic pricing" (like how Uber prices change during rain).

::: callout-important
## Career note for international students (general guidance):

These roles are **often the most H-1B-friendly** in digital marketing because they more clearly map to specialized, degree-linked skill sets (statistics, analytics, data science, computing), and because larger employers who sponsor are more likely to hire for these positions.
:::

**4. Strategy & Leadership Roles (often mid-career+)**

As you move up the ladder, the focus shifts from "doing" to "planning." These are the jobs that are not likely to be within the reach right after you graduate unless you have already sufficient experience in other specialty jobs in Content & Creative Roles or Technology and Performance Roles.

-   **Digital Marketing Manager:** Oversees the entire digital strategy and manages a team of specialists.

-   **Growth Marketer:** A data-heavy role focused on the entire customer lifecycle—not just getting new customers, but keeping them.

-   **Product Marketing Manager:** Focuses specifically on how a single product is positioned and launched in the market.

-   **Chief Marketing Officer (CMO):** The highest executive level, responsible for the brand’s total marketing vision and budget.

::: callout-tip
## Recommendations

Based on the immediate target career roles right after graduation, my recommendation for Degree Emphasis would be different as follows:

-   If you prefer to take **Content & Creative Roles,** such as content writer/SEO writer, copy writer, social media manager, and graphics/visual designer –\> choose **Digital Marketing Strategy Emphasis**.

-   If you prefer to take **Technical & Performance Roles**, such as SEO Specialist, PPC Specialist, and Email Marketing Specialist –\> choose **Balanced/Mixed Option**.

-   If you prefer to take **Analytics (Marketing Data Specialist) Roles**, such as Marketing Data Analytist, Marketing Data Scientist, and Marketing Data Engineer –\> choose **Marketing Analytics Emphasis**.
