:::

::: callout-tip
### Tips

In deciding the two things above, refer to the next four sections, which are listed below

-   [**Curriculum (New Curriculum)**](#curriculum-new-curriculum)

-   [**Curriculum Roadmaps**](#curriculum-roadmaps)

-   [**Factors to Consider When Choosing Degree Emphasis**](#factors-to-consider-when-choosing-degree-emphasis)

-   [**Choosing a 1-Year vs. 2-Year Roadmap**](#choosing-a-1-year-vs.-2-year-roadmap)

Once you made an informed decision. fill out the **curriculum contract form** below and email a **roadmap spreadsheet** to your academic advisor, who is the MSDM program director.
:::

## **Step 2: Know the Curriculum (Degree Emphasis) Options** {#curriculum-new-curriculum}

::: callout-caution
It is important that you align your aspired job roles after graduation with the Degree Emphasis. To learn about career and job roles, refer to [Typical Job Roles in Digital Marketing](career_outlook_salary_digital_marketing.qmd#content-creative-roles) section of the Careers page and come back here to proceed.
:::

![MS in Digital Marketing Program Curriculum](images/Curriculum_Emphasis.png){fig-alt="It is a screenshot of the MS in Digital Marketing Program Curriculum"}

For the [Curriculum Overview](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/new-msdm-curriculum.shtml), you may visit the official web page for the curriculum, but the implication is that there are basically three curriculum options for you. Select the one that would be best match for your aspired career path. In Step 4, you will be provided with the factors to consider when choosing degree emphasis.

-   **Three Curriculum (Degree Emphasis) Options**

    1.  [**Digital Marketing Strategy (DMS) Emphasis**](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/msdm-digital-marketing-strategy-emphasis.shtml)

        -   This emphasis is best suited for students who want to have a career in **Content & Creative Roles,** such as Content Writer/SEO Writer and Social Media Manager.
        -   For **Major Electives: *Emphasis Recommended***, choose all 10 units under DMS Emphasis: IBM 6100, IBM 6150, IBM 6250, and IBM 6300
        -   For **Major Electives: *Emphasis Other***, choose IBM 6450 and one more course from any other graduate-level IBM-prefix courses or GBA 5140.

    2.  [**Marketing Analytics (MA) Emphasis**](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/msdm-marketing-analytics-emphasis.shtml)

        -   This emphasis is best suited for students who want to have a career in **Marketing Data Specialist Roles** such as Marketing Data Scientist, Marketing Engineer, and Marketing Data Analyst.
        -   For **Major Electives: *Emphasis Recommended***, choose all 10 units under MA Emphasis: IBM 6520, IBM 6530, IBM 6540, and IBM 6600
        -   For **Major Electives: *Emphasis Other***, choose IBM 6700 and one more course from any other graduate-level IBM-prefix courses or GBA 6520.

    3.  **Balanced/Customized**

        -   This track is best suited for students who want to have a career in various **Technical & Performance Roles** such as *SEO Specialist*, *PPC Specialist*, *Email Marketing Specialist*, *Marketing data analyst*, except for Marketing Data Scientist or Marketing Engineer, for which MA Emphasis will be a better fit.

        -   If you want to be **well-rounded** so that you can be prepared for various digital marketing roles across content, performance, and analytics, **balanced option** will be ideal.

        -   This option allows you to choose courses from both emphases to **tailor** to your **career needs** and your **current set of skills and knowledge**. For example, if you have been working as a social media coordinator for an organization and want to keep pursuing your career on **Content and Creative Roles**, you should have pretty good working knowledge about social media platforms and strategy. In that case, there is no reason to take IBM 6250 (Social Media Marketing); instead, you can take any other remaining electives (from MA Emphasis) to expand your skills and knowledge.

## **Step 3: Know Curriculum Completion Roadmap Options** {#curriculum-roadmaps}

Each course is offered **only once per year** in a designated term due to prerequisites and scheduling constraints.

### 2-Year Completion Roadmap

-   **Availability:**

    -   Available for both Fall and Spring admissions

    -   Spring admits may complete in 1.5 years

-   [Digital Marketing Strategy Emphasis](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/msdm-digital-marketing-strategy-emphasis.shtml)

-   [Marketing Analytics Emphasis](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/msdm-marketing-analytics-emphasis.shtml)

### 1-Year Completion Roadmap

-   **Availability:**

    -   Available ***only for fall admission***.

    -   **Not available for spring admission**.

-   [Digital Marketing Strategy Emphasis](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/msdm-digital-marketing-strategy-emphasis.shtml)

-   [Marketing Analytics Emphasis](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/msdm-marketing-analytics-emphasis.shtml)

### **Spring Admits**

Students starting in Spring can finish in **2 years** or **1.5 years**.

In the first fall semester, Spring admits can take:

-   IBM 6010 (Make-up)

-   IBM 5910 (Make-up)

-   IBM 6500 (Required for second fall)

-   IBM 6200 (Required for second fall)

## **Step 4: Consider These Factors When Choosing Degree Emphasis** {#factors-to-consider-when-choosing-degree-emphasis}

Choosing between **Digital Marketing Strategy, Marketing Analytics,** and **Balanced/Customized Option** requires careful thought. Below are key factors to guide your decision.

### VISA Status (Domestic vs. International Students)

#### Domestic Students

Domestic students typically face fewer constraints in hiring. Job outcomes depend mainly on experience, skill fit, and flexibility on role, location, and compensation.

#### International Students

International students often face different hiring realities:

**A. OPT/STEM OPT is usually “easier” for employers than H-1B**

-   During OPT/STEM OPT, you already have work authorization, so many employers can hire you with relatively low legal burden.

-   For **STEM OPT**, employers must be in **E-Verify** and support the student’s **Form I-983 training plan** requirements.

**B. H-1B is employer-sponsored and more demanding**

-   H-1B requires the employer to file an H-1B petition for a **“specialty occupation”** role (typically one that requires a bachelor’s degree or higher in a **specific specialty**).

-   Employers must also file a **Labor Condition Application (LCA)** and attest to wage and working condition requirements.

**C. Hiring on OPT and sponsoring H-1B are often different decisions**

-   An employer may be willing to hire for OPT/STEM OPT but not sponsor H-1B because H-1B involves legal filings, fees, compliance obligations, and (for many employers) timing uncertainty.

::: callout-tip
#### Bottom line (General guidance):

If your priority is maximizing long-term U.S. work options, you are often better positioned in roles that clearly align with **specialized, degree-linked skills**—especially **analytics** and **more technical performance/MarTech** roles.

-   **Marketing Analytics emphasis**: generally strongest alignment with “specialty occupation” patterns (measurement, experimentation, modeling, data work).

-   **Balanced/Mixed option**: a strong second choice if you intentionally build technical/analytics depth (e.g., SQL, analytics implementation, experimentation, BI).

-   **Digital Marketing Strategy emphasis**: can still lead to great careers, but sponsorship can be less common in roles that are primarily creative, coordination, or generalist execution—because degree specificity may be harder to document.

***Note***: This is general information, not legal advice. Sponsorship depends on the employer, the exact job description, and current rules.

### Your Passion

Entry to mid-level career jobs in Digital Marketing can be grouped under three big categories before they move into leadership roles. For details about the taxonomy, refer to [Typical Job Roles in Digital Marketing](career_outlook_salary_digital_marketing.qmd#typical-job-titles).

1.  Content & Creative Roles

2.  Techncial & Performance Roles

3.  Analytics (Marketing Data Specialist) Roles

::: callout-tip
## Recommendations

Based on the immediate career goal right after graduation, my recommendation for Degree Emphasis would be different as follows:

-   If you prefer to take **Content & Creative Roles,** such as content writer/SEO writer, copy writer, social media manager, and graphics/visual designer –\> choose **Digital Marketing Strategy Emphasis**.

-   If you prefer to take **Technical & Performance Roles**, such as SEO Specialist, PPC Specialist, and Email Marketing Specialist –\> choose **Balanced/Mixed Option**.

-   If you prefer to take **Analytics (Marketing Data Specialist) Roles**, such as Marketing Data Analytist, Marketing Data Scientist, and Marketing Data Engineer –\> choose **Marketing Analytics Emphasis**.
:::

### Pay (ROI) Considerations

> For the early career stage of jobs you will be seeking right after graduation, we will focus on the three roles below, leaving out the strategy/leadership roles, which are the latter stage of your career.

1.  **Content & Creative Roles**

    -   **Content Marketer/Copywriter**: \$61,000 – \$73,660
    -   **Social Media Manager**: \$64,000 – \$74,536

2.  **Technical & Performance Roles**

    -   **SEO Specialist** / Analyst**:** \$66,000 – \$81,407
    -   **PPC / Paid Media Specialist:** \$70,000 - \$81,000
    -   **Email / CRM Specialist**: \$79,911 – \$95,000

3.  **Analytics Roles**

    -   **Marketing Data Analyst**: \$82,000 – \$93,336
    -   **Marketing Data Scientist**: \$118,000 – \$165,018
    -   **Marketing Data Engineer:** \$134,000 – \$195,000

> For details, go to the [Job Outlook and Salary](career_outlook_salary_digital_marketing.qmd#job-growth-rate-volume-and-salary) section.

::: callout-tip
#### Tips

-   In general, Return On Investment is in this order: **Analytics Roles** \> **Technical & Performance Roles** \> **Content & Creative Roles**.

-   If you’re aiming for the highest ROI (typically, higher pay), **analytics roles** are often the best path. In that case, consider choosing the **Marketing Analytics Emphasis**.
:::

### Upward mobility

Many students pursue a master’s degree to advance their careers.

> **Note on career stage:** Strategy and leadership roles are often **mid-career+**. Many MSDM graduates start in specialist roles (content, performance, or analytics) and move into strategy/leadership after building execution + measurement + cross-functional experience. The pathway for the students would be like this:
>
> -   **Entry-level:** Coordinator, Specialist, Analyst (Jr.)
>
> -   **Mid-level:** Manager, Strategist, Senior Specialist/Analyst
>
> -   **Senior:** Lead, Director, Head of Growth/Marketing

A common pattern is:

-   Students with digital marketing work experience often reach a ceiling due to **limited analytics skills**.

-   Higher-level roles (e.g., Director, VP of Digital Marketing) generally require **balanced knowledge** of strategy *and* analytics.

::: callout-tip
#### Recommendations:

-   If you already have several years of digital marketing experience → Consider **Marketing Analytics** courses.

-   If you handle data but lack confidence in statistics or machine learning → Strengthen your **Marketing Analytics** foundation.
:::

### Strategic Consideration

You are not required to follow the recommended elective lists exactly. Choose the courses that best strengthen your skills and make you a well-rounded professional. We support a customized curriculum within the allowed electives. This makes the **Balanced/Mixed Option** attractive.

## **Step 5: Consider These Factors in Choosing a 1-Year vs. 2-Year Roadmap** {#choosing-a-1-year-vs.-2-year-roadmap}

As you prepare for your curriculum contract and make an appointment to meet with me, I want to provide you with some information to consider in your decision to choose a 1-year vs. a 2-year completion roadmap. 

::: panel-tabset
### 2-Year Completion Roadmap:

**Recommended if any of the following are true**

-   You are working while in the program.

-   You have limited preparation in math, statistics, or programming.

-   You want more time to strengthen English skills.

-   You are an international student who needs time to acclimate.

-   You want to participate fully in extracurricular activities (club, competitions, workshops, symposiums).

### 1-Year Completion Roadmap:

**Doable if most of the following apply**

-   You do not have a job or family responsibilities.

-   You have taken college algebra, calculus, and at least one statistics course.

-   You earned a BS in Business Administration from an AACSB-accredited university.

-   You are an international student planning to return home immediately after graduation and want to minimize cost.
:::

-   **Financial Impact: 1-Year vs. 2-Year Roadmap**

    Tuition is the same overall, but **auxiliary fees differ**:

    -   Auxiliary fees: \~\$850/semester, \~\$400/summer

    -   Two-year students pay more total auxiliary fees

    -   One-year students save approximately **\$2,100**

## **Step 6: Plan Your Roadmap with Worksheets** {#plan-your-roadmap-with-worksheets}

> Use one of the ***worksheets*** below to plan your curriculum roadmap for the duration of your study. As you plan, be sure to follow the [Course Registration Instructions](course_registration.qmd#before-you-register-what-every-msdm-student-should-know).
>
> For more information about the **curriculum completion roadmap**, see the [Curriculum Roadmap Section](#curriculum-new-curriculum).

3.  Once I receive an email with your Curriculum Roadmap Worksheet, I will review it and ***give you feedback***.

4.  Your Curriculum Worksheet will be placed under your folder. If you ever needs to change curriculum later, contact me. I will be happy to discuss with you and assisting you in finding best courses for your career path.

5.  [**Failure to submit the curriculum contract and roadmap worksheet will result in an academic hold**]{style="color: red; font-weight: bold;"}, which will prevent you from registering for future courses.

## **Step 8: Register for Courses** {#register-for-courses}

1.  Before registering each semester, review your **Curriculum Completion Roadmap Worksheet**. It helps you plan course sequencing and stay on track for graduation.

2.  For detailed on courses available for a specific semester, go to the [**Course Registration**](course_registration.qmd)tab in the menu.

3.  After you register for your first semester, consider taking [**Boot Camp short courses**](msdm_bootcamp.qmd) if you'd like to strengthen your skills in Excel or R (including Statistics).

4.  You can also review [**Course-Skill-Tools alignment table**](skills_tools_courses.qmd#course-skill-tools) to better understand what each course emphasizes and what to expect.
