# **Skills Employers Look for in Digital Marketing Roles** {#skills-and-knowledge-for-dms-careers}

## Core Digital Marketing Skills

Employers expect a strong grounding in marketing principles + digital execution:

-   **SEO/SEM**: Keyword research, on-page SEO, technical SEO, Google Ads.

-   **Content Marketing**: Strategy, writing, optimizing for engagement & conversions.

-   **Performance Marketing**: Paid search, display, social ads, ROI optimization.

-   **Marketing Automation**: HubSpot, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Marketo, etc.

-   **Campaign Analytics**: Attribution models, funnel analysis, ROI tracking.

## Analytics & Data Skills

This is where **R, Python, SQL, and BI tools** give candidates a big edge:

-   **Data Wrangling & Analysis**: SQL (databases), R/Python for data cleaning and modeling.

-   **Web & Campaign Analytics**: Google Analytics 4 (GA4), Tag Manager, Looker Studio.

-   **Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)** & Attribution: Understanding how channels drive results.

-   **A/B Testing & Experimentation**: Experimental design, statistical analysis.

-   **Dashboarding & Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI, R Shiny, or Quarto for storytelling.

-   **Big Data Tools** (nice-to-have): Working with APIs, warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake), Arrow/duckdb for large datasets.

## Tech & Emerging Tools

-   **Quarto / RMarkdown**: Reproducible reports & documentation.

-   **Machine Learning Basics**: Predictive modeling, recommendation systems (entry-level knowledge is often enough for marketing roles).

-   **AI for Marketing**: Understanding how GenAI is applied to content creation, personalization, and customer insights.

## Business & Soft Skills

This often makes or breaks candidates:

-   **Storytelling with Data**: Translating analytics into business recommendations.

-   **Project Management**: Agile workflows, cross-team collaboration.

-   **Communication**: Explaining technical insights to non-technical stakeholders.

-   **Problem Solving**: Turning ambiguous marketing challenges into testable, data-driven solutions.

-   **Commercial Awareness**: Understanding ROI, CAC, CLV, and KPIs that matter to business leaders.

## Skill Bundles by Role Type

To help your students target **different flavors of digital marketing roles**:

-   **Digital Marketing Analyst / Data Scientist**
    -   SQL, R/Python, A/B testing, MMM, GA4, dashboarding.
-   **Performance Marketing Specialist**
    -   Paid ads, GA4, attribution, campaign optimization, Excel/SQL.
-   **Marketing Automation / CRM Specialist**
    -   Email automation tools, segmentation, lifecycle marketing, A/B testing.
-   **Growth Marketer**
    -   Blend of analytics + campaign execution + experimentation mindset.
-   **Digital Marketing Manager (strategic)**
    -   Team leadership, vendor management, high-level analytics (dashboards, ROI tracking).

::: callout-important
### 👉 **Bottom Line:**

Employers want **marketers who can work with data**. Even if they’re not “full data scientists,” knowing **SQL + R/Python basics + GA4 + A/B testing** gives them a **big competitive edge** in digital marketing roles. Pair that with **strong storytelling and business impact communication**, and they’re highly employable.
:::

## Social Media Marketing Managers & Content Creators

### Core skills they **must have**:

-   **Platform expertise**: Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube, X (ads + organic).

-   **Content strategy**: Matching brand voice with platform audience.

-   **Creative skills**: Copywriting, design tools (Canva, Adobe suite), short-form video.

-   **Community management**: Engaging audiences, managing comments, brand reputation.

-   **Campaign performance**: Reading dashboards (reach, engagement, CTR, conversions).

### Data skills (nice-to-have, but not the core):

-   **Basic analytics literacy**:
    -   Understanding metrics (CTR, engagement rate, conversion rate, ROAS).

    -   A/B testing creatives (e.g., which ad copy/video works better).

<!-- -->

-   **Intermediate (optional, career-boosting)**:
    -   SQL/R/Python not essential, but *helpful* if they want to grow into a broader analytics or digital marketing manager role.

    -   Knowing how to pull performance data from APIs (e.g., Meta Ads, Google Ads) is a differentiator, but not expected for most content roles.

::: callout-important
### 👉 **Bottom line**:

SMMs and content creators don’t need deep DBI/dbplyr/Arrow-level skills. They need to be *data-aware* — capable of interpreting dashboards and making creative/strategy decisions from them.
:::

## Digital Marketing Managers

### Core expectations:

-   **Strategic oversight** of campaigns across channels (search, social, display, email, web).

-   **Budget management**: Allocating spend across channels for ROI.

-   **Team coordination**: Overseeing content, social, analytics, and performance specialists.

-   **Vendor/agency management**: Communicating expectations and results.

### Data skills (increasingly important):

-   **Definitely needed**:
    -   Comfort with **dashboards** (GA4, Looker Studio, Tableau, Power BI).

    -   Ability to interpret **attribution reports** (which channels drive conversions).

    -   Understanding **MMM outputs** or campaign lift studies (even if they don’t build the models).

    -   Running/overseeing **A/B tests** (e.g., subject lines, ad targeting).

<!-- -->

-   **Not always required**:
    -   Hands-on SQL/R/Python isn’t required in every company — but managers who can *at least query a database or validate results* have a strong edge.

    -   In larger organizations, they’ll work with analysts who do the heavy lifting.

    -   In startups/lean teams, managers often do both **strategy + basic analytics**, so SQL/Excel may be expected.

::: callout-tip
👉 **Bottom line**:

Digital Marketing Managers *must* be **data-literate** (able to interpret and act on analytics). They don’t always need to *code models themselves*, but they need to **manage data-driven decision-making**. If they aspire to higher-level performance or growth roles, learning **SQL** and analytics basics is a significant advantage.
:::

## Practical Advice for Students

-   **Content/Social-focused careers** → Prioritize creative skills, platform mastery, and *basic* analytics literacy.

-   **Managerial/strategic careers** → Prioritize **data literacy** and decision-making with data. Hands-on coding isn’t always mandatory, but understanding the outputs of analytics (MMM, attribution, segmentation) is critical.

::: callout-caution
### 👉 Do They Need Analytics?

-   **Social media managers & content creators** don’t need deep data science skills — dashboards and campaign analytics literacy are enough.

-   **Digital marketing managers** *do* need stronger data skills (not necessarily coding, but strong analytics interpretation). Those who can bridge **creativity + analytics** are the ones who move up fastest.

# **Marketing Analysts and Marketing Data Scientists: Skills and Knowledge** {#skills-and-knowledge-for-analytics-careers}

## Career Preparations for Marketing Analytics Career

Data science jobs tailored for marketing is different from regular data science jobs or business analytics. So, again, I consulted GPT 5. My MS in Digital Marketing students asked me if they will be ready for job market as marketing data scientist if they use R and don't use Python. What advice would you give them?

### **R is absolutely a marketable skill, but Python often gives an edge**

-   **R strengths**: It’s fantastic for statistics, econometrics, experimental design, marketing mix modeling, and survey data analysis—all things marketing analysts and data scientists need. Many marketing and social science–oriented companies (consultancies, CPG, ad-tech, agencies) rely on R.

-   **Python strengths**: It dominates in machine learning engineering, AI, data pipelines, and production-level work. If the job involves deploying models at scale or working closely with engineers, Python is usually the standard.

### **Employers care about the *core skills***

-   Knowing **how to design experiments, analyze consumer data, build predictive models, interpret insights, and communicate recommendations** matters more than the specific tool.

-   If you can demonstrate strong knowledge in data wrangling, modeling, visualization, and storytelling, you’re employable—whether in R, Python, or even SQL + BI tools.

### **Bridging R to the job market**

-   **For analytics-heavy roles (marketing research, econometrics, MMM, A/B testing, segmentation, customer insights):** R is more than enough.

-   **For ML/AI-heavy roles (recommendation systems, NLP on consumer text, computer vision for ad content):** You’ll likely need Python.

### **What I’d recommend to them**

-   **Get excellent at R first.** Become fluent in tidyverse, modeling packages, and reporting (e.g., RMarkdown/Shiny).

-   **Pick up Python basics** along the way (especially pandas, scikit-learn, maybe TensorFlow/PyTorch if they’re ambitious). Even if they’re not fluent, just showing “working knowledge” reduces employer concerns.

-   **Always highlight transferable skills.** Frame your résumé and interviews around what you can *do* with data (segmentation, predictive models, campaign optimization), not just which software you use.

::: callout-tip
### 👉 So the bottom line to students would be:

Yes, you can be job-ready with just R for many marketing analytics and data science roles. But if you want to maximize opportunities—especially in ML-heavy or tech-company contexts—adding at least some Python competency will make you more competitive.

## What is Positron?

**Positron** is a free, next-generation data science IDE from Posit (formerly RStudio) that supports both **Python and R** natively—it’s designed for polyglot workflows. It’s built on the open-source **Code OSS** (the foundation of VS Code) and brings a modern, extensible environment tailored for data work

Key features include:

-   **Variable & Data Frame Explorer**: Explore, filter, sort, and summarize your data interactively

-   **Multi‑Session Console**: Run R and Python code in parallel, each in separate consoles, without modifying your source files

-   **Interpreter & Environment Management**: Easily switch between different R and Python environments

-   **Polished UI & AI Assistance**: Includes a modern editor with support for VSIX extensions and the Positron Assistant for contextual AI-based help

-   **Database Connection Pane**: Built-in support for browsing and querying SQL data sources directly within the IDE

-   **Integrated Data App Workflow**: Launch and debug Shiny, Streamlit, Dash, or FastAPI apps with a single click

## How Does It Compare to RStudio for Data Warehouse Integration?

RStudio remains a highly stable and familiar environment for R work, especially in statistical modeling and reproducible reporting with R Markdown or Quarto. However, when it comes to interfacing with data warehouses—typically SQL-heavy work—Positron offers distinct advantages:

### Advantages of Positron:

1.  **Built-In SQL Integration**: The Database Connection Pane lets users connect to and query SQL data sources right inside the IDE, making data-access streamlined.

2.  **Polyglot Workflow**: For teams or students who may use both R and Python for ETL, modeling, or automation, Positron lets them do so in one session—no context-switching needed.

3.  **Modern, Customizable UI**: Being based on VS Code, Positron supports a wide ecosystem of extensions, customizable layout, and flexible workflows

### Things to Keep in Mind:

-   **Active Development**: Positron is still relatively new and under active development. Some features familiar from RStudio—like inline output in Quarto documents, workspace autosave on restart, history pane, and RStudio Add-ins—are not yet fully implemented.

-   **Learning Curve**: Switching from RStudio may take some onboarding time, especially for users accustomed to its tightly integrated interface

-   **Foundation**: RStudio continues to be maintained with a focus on stability, especially for R-heavy workflows. Positron is additive, not a replacement

## Judgment Call: Is Positron Better for Data Warehouse Workflows?

**Yes—especially for workflows involving SQL or dual-language environments.** Here’s why:

-   The built-in SQL pane and query tools make accessing warehouse data naturally part of the coding workflow.

-   Students can seamlessly move between R and Python, which many real-world jobs require.

-   The VS Code-based engine makes Positron extensible, customizable, and future-facing.

That said, if the student is focused primarily on R and relies heavily on RMarkdown, Addins, or a very streamlined R-focused workflow, RStudio may still feel more polished.

## Recommendation for Marketing Data Science Tools

-   **For SQL-heavy, polyglot, or app-deployment workflows**: Experiment with **Positron**. Its features align well with modern data engineering and analytics workflows.

-   **For R-focused, academic, or reproducibility-heavy tasks**: **RStudio** remains excellent and highly reliable—especially for teaching foundations in R.

### What to install (minimum viable setup)

1.  **R in VS Code**

-   Extension: **“R” (REditorSupport)** — consoles, data viewer, plots pane, workspace browser, debugging, Rmd support. ([Visual Studio Marketplace;](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r&utm_source=chatgpt.com "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=reditorsupport.r&utm_source=chatgpt.com")[Visual Studio Code;](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r?utm_source=chatgpt.com "https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r?utm_source=chatgpt.com")[GitHub.](https://github.com/REditorSupport/vscode-R?search=1&utm_source=chatgpt.com "https://github.com/reditorsupport/vscode-r?search=1&utm_source=chatgpt.com"))

-   Helpful bits:

    -   `languageserver` for IDE features (autocomplete, linting). ([jozef.io](https://jozef.io/r300-language-server-setup/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "https://jozef.io/r300-language-server-setup/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"))

    -   `httpgd` for a great plot viewer (enable “R: Plot: Use httpgd”). Note: currently installed from GitHub. ([Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52284345/how-to-show-r-graph-from-visual-studio-code?utm_source=chatgpt.com "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52284345/how-to-show-r-graph-from-visual-studio-code?utm_source=chatgpt.com"))

2.  **Quarto**

-   Install Quarto CLI, then VS Code **“Quarto”** extension for render/preview and project workflows (websites/books).

3.  **Python**

-   Extensions: **Python**, **Pylance**, and **Jupyter** (first-class support; active monthly releases; new dedicated **Python Environments** panel rolling out). ([Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python&utm_source=chatgpt.com "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=ms-python.python&utm_source=chatgpt.com"); [Microsoft for Developers+1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-july-2025-release/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-july-2025-release/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"); [Visual Studio Magazine](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2025/08/18/dedicated-python-environments-tool-rolls-out-in-vs-code-update.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com "https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2025/08/18/dedicated-python-environments-tool-rolls-out-in-vs-code-update.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com"))

### Connecting to data warehouses (three good paths)

**A. Pure SQL inside VS Code**

-   Use **SQLTools** plus the driver for your warehouse (Snowflake, Databricks, Postgres, etc.) to browse schemas and run queries inline.

-   Examples:

    -   **Snowflake** VS Code extension (SQL + Snowpark integration).

    -   **Databricks** driver for SQLTools (query SQL Warehouses directly).

-   FYI for Microsoft stacks: Azure Data Studio is being retired in 2026; Microsoft recommends moving to VS Code + SQL extensions. [Microsoft LearnLinks to an external site.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/whats-happening-azure-data-studio?utm_source=chatgpt.com "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/whats-happening-azure-data-studio?utm_source=chatgpt.com")

**B. R + DBI/odbc from your code**

-   Use **DBI** with **odbc** (or backend-specific drivers like `RPostgres`, `bigrquery`) and optionally `dbplyr` to write dplyr that translates to SQL.

**C. Python from your code**

-   Use **SQLAlchemy**, **pyodbc**, **snowflake-snowpark-python**, or **databricks-sql-connector** within VS Code’s Python/Jupyter workflow (extensions above cover environments and notebooks). (General pattern supported by the Python/Jupyter extensions.)

### VS Code vs. Positron vs. RStudio (for your use case)

-   **VS Code**: Most mature **polyglot** environment today; deep SQL tooling; constant releases; huge extension ecosystem (including Quarto). Great when students mix R, Python, and warehouse SQL.

-   **Positron**: Promising R+Python IDE from Posit with data/variable explorer and SQL pane, but still maturing; some RStudio niceties aren’t fully there yet. If you need “ready today” for warehousing, VS Code wins on stability and breadth. (Context: Positron pages highlight active development and gaps vs RStudio.)

-   **RStudio**: Still superb for **R-first** teaching (R Markdown/Quarto, tidyverse, Shiny) but not as strong for multi-language + warehouse dev as VS Code’s ecosystem.

### Bottom line

If Positron feels a bit early for you right now, **VS Code is the best “bridge”**: rock-solid for **R + Quarto + Python** and excellent for **data-warehouse** workflows via SQLTools/warehouse extensions or via DBI/odbc inside your code. It’s a great environment to standardize on for your cohort this year.

## Micro-Internship

### What Is Mirco-Internship?

> At Cal Poly Pomona, a micro-internship is a short-term, paid, project-based professional assignment (usually 5-40 hours) that lets students quickly gain hands-on experience, explore career paths, build skills, and network with employers, functioning as an alternative or precursor to traditional internships and available year-round, often remotely. These projects mimic tasks given to new hires, such as market research or content creation, and are managed through [Parker Dewey](https://info.parkerdewey.com/cpp) via the university's Innovation Incubator.
