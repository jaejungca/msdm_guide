## [**Introduction**]{style="color: #FF991C"}

> Information about international students is often scattered across different pages, and it can be hard to find clear, role-specific guidance on how to plan your pathway. This page is designed to give you a comprehensive overview of what matters most for international students considering Cal Poly Pomona’s Master of Science in Digital Marketing (MSDM)—especially how the STEM designation supports work authorization timelines, but why your career strategy (the roles you target) is also critical for long-term sponsorship prospects.

::: callout-important
International students often ask about tuition, funding, OPT/STEM OPT, and whether three years of work authorization guarantees H‑1B sponsorship. The honest answer is: **STEM helps, but role strategy matters.** CPP’s **MS in Digital Marketing (MSDM) is STEM-designated**, and this page explains the financial and career pathway details—including scholarships, on-campus jobs, and micro-internships—especially why, for international students, the strongest pathway is usually targeting **Marketing Data & Analytics** and the **technical end of Technical & Performance** roles (rather than primarily content/creative tracks), where skills are measurable and employer demand is often stronger.
:::

## **MSDM for International Students (STEM-Designated)**

If you’re an international student considering Cal Poly Pomona’s **M.S. in Digital Marketing (MSDM)**, you’re probably evaluating four things:

1)  **Tuition & total cost**\
2)  **Scholarships / assistantships / campus jobs**\
3)  **OPT / STEM OPT (work authorization timeline)**\
4)  **Post-OPT sponsorship (H‑1B and other long-term options)**

This page is designed to give you **accurate, role-specific guidance**—so you can decide whether CPP MSDM is the right fit **and** how to plan your **pathway**.

## **Quick Facts that Matter** (cost + structure)

-   **Program units:** 34 total units (20 core + 14 electives)\
-   **Tuition:** \$825 per unit\
-   **Estimated tuition total:** \$28,050\
-   **Estimated total tuition + mandatory fees:** varies by 1-year vs 2-year completion roadmap\
-   **Out-of-state / international tuition note:** Students outside California (including international students) pay the **same per-unit tuition** in this program structure.

👉 See full details here: [https://www.cppmsdm.com/application#tuition-fees](application.qmd#tuition-fees)

## **STEM Designation & OPT**

::: {.callout-important title="what it helps (and what it doesn’t)"}
**Yes:** MSDM is **officially STEM-designated**, which can support eligibility for a longer post-graduation work authorization timeline (OPT + STEM OPT).

**No:** STEM designation does **not** guarantee long-term sponsorship (H‑1B is a separate employer decision and a separate process).
:::

### Important: OPT vs H‑1B are two different employer decisions

Many employers treat these as two separate “yes/no” decisions:

-   **Hiring you on OPT/STEM OPT (short-term work authorization):** often easier *if* you already have valid authorization. All international students in this program will be eligible for STEM OPT. They have no problem hiring you.

-   **Sponsoring long-term work authorization later (ex: H‑1B):** bigger commitment (legal, compliance, budgeting, role fit). This is where your specialty matters.

::: {.callout-important title="Bottom line"}
Don’t assume “if they hire me on OPT, they will sponsor later.” You should ask directly and early.

## **Career strategy**

::: {.callout-important title="Advice"}
**Pick role lanes that are more sponsorship-aligned**
:::

Digital marketing careers typically fall into four role families:

1)  **Content & Creative Roles**\

2)  **Technical & Performance Roles**\

3)  **Marketing Data & Analytics Roles**\

4)  **Strategy & Leadership Roles** (often mid-career+)

### If long-term U.S. work is a priority, focus here:

#### Marketing Data & Analytics Roles (typically the strongest alignment)

**Examples:** 

-   Marketing Analyst / Digital Marketing Analyst

-   Marketing Data Analyst

-   Marketing Data Scientist (advanced)

**Why this lane tends to be more sponsorship-friendly:**

-   Skills map more clearly to “specialized knowledge + degree alignment” (analytics, statistics, experimentation, computing)

-   Larger employers that sponsor often hire for these roles

**Portfolio signals that help:**

-   SQL + dashboarding + experiment design

-   R/Python projects with clear business outcomes

-   Measurement frameworks, forecasting, segmentation

#### Technical & Performance Roles (best when they’re truly technical)

**Examples:**

-   SEO Specialist (technical SEO + measurement)

-   PPC / Paid Media Specialist (tracking + experimentation)

-   Email / CRM / Marketing Automation Specialist

**Why this lane can work well:**

-   When the role includes **analytics implementation, tagging, automation, dashboards, experimentation**, it becomes more “specialized”

-   Strong fit when you build a measurable performance portfolio (ROI, attribution logic, testing)

**Portfolio signals that help:**

-   GA4 + GTM + Looker Studio dashboards

-   SQL basics (even basic SQL helps)

-   Marketing automation / CRM tooling experience

### Lanes that are valid—but often more variable for sponsorship

#### Content & Creative Roles

**Examples:**

-   Social Media Manager

-   Content Writer

-   Copywriter

-   Designer

::: {.callout-caution title="Caution"}
These can be great careers, but sponsorship is often less common because many roles are viewed as more generalist and are frequently hired by smaller teams/agencies.
:::

#### Strategy & Leadership Roles (usually not immediate post-grad)

These roles are often reached after experience in the other lanes, so they are not for rookies.

## **How CPP MSDM supports these paths** (curriculum options + tools) {#how-cpp-msdm-supports-these-paths}

### Three Elective Options (you choose based on target career roles)

You’ll complete 34 units total (20 core + 14 elective units), and you can choose electives using one of three options:

1)  **Digital Marketing Strategy emphasis**\
2)  **Marketing Analytics emphasis**\
3)  **Balanced / Customized option**

::: {.callout-tip title="Program recommendation (role-based):"}
-   If you target **Technical & Performance** roles → choose the **Balanced/Mixed** option

-   If you target **Marketing Data & Analytics** roles → choose the **Marketing Analytics** emphasis

-   If you target **Content & Creative** roles → choose the **Digital Marketing Strategy** emphasis
:::

👉 Curriculum options + completion roadmaps:\
[https://www.cppmsdm.com/application#curriculum-completion-roadmap-options](application.qmd#curriculum-completion-roadmap-options)

### Tools You’ll Build (varies by your course/elective choices)

Depending on your roadmap and electives, students develop skills using tools such as:

-   GA4, GTM, Looker Studio, BigQuery
-   Google Ads / paid platforms
-   Tableau / Power BI
-   SQL + R (and sometimes Python / ML tooling in analytics electives)

👉 Skills/Tools/Courses alignment (great for planning):\
[https://www.cppmsdm.com/skills_tools_courses](skills_tools_courses.qmd)

## **Real Experience while You Study:** Micro-internships + On-campus Jobs {#real-experience-while-you-study}

### On-campus jobs

Many students find on-campus roles across departments. Jobs are commonly posted via Handshake.

👉 On-Campus Jobs and Internships:\
[https://www.cppmsdm.com/application#jobs-and-internships](application#jobs-and-internships)

### Micro-Internships (paid, project-based experience)

> Some MSDM courses include **micro-internship experiences** where you work with a real client and complete paid, course-embedded projects. Click here for more details about [**micro-internships**](career_prep_digital_marketing_marketing_analytics.qmd#micro-internships)

::: {.callout-tip title="Why it’s great for international students"}

When a micro-internship is required as part of a course, exceptions may apply regarding typical **CPT timing** so that you can participate in it even in your first semester — always confirm details with the Micro-Internship Coordinator and the international student office. 
:::

## **Scholarships & Assistantships (what to expect)** {#scholarships-assistantships}

### Scholarships (limited, but available)

-   Recruitment Scholarship (no separate application; evaluated from admission materials)

-   Professional Development Scholarship (often after at least one semester; may support certifications)

-   Merit-based scholarships and other campus opportunities may be available depending on eligibility

👉 Scholarship list:\
[https://www.cppmsdm.com/application#scholarships](application.qmd#scholarships)

### Assistantships (limited availability)

-   **TA and RA roles exist**, but availability is limited and competitive. You can apply for these positions through the university’s job portal called Handshake. To apply for the jobs, you must first enroll in courses.

-   These jobs are posted on Handshake and may require specific skills or experience. They can provide valuable experience and financial support but should not be the primary financial plan.

-   TA or RA are [**not awarded as part of the admissions process**]{.underline}, and they are not guaranteed for all students. Students must individually approach faculty who are in need of TA and appeal. Faculty usually have multiple students expressing their interest, so faculty will evaluate candidates based on a combination of factors, including academic performance, relevant experience, and the needs of the department. You can **only apply for these positions after you have enrolled in courses** and have access to **Handshake**.

::: {.callout-tip title="Tips for Securing TA/RA Positions"}
If you are interested in TA/RA opportunities, apply to the program early and get admitted early so that you have sufficient time to do research. We admit students on a rolling basis.
:::

## **“Right fit” Checklist** (who tends to thrive here) {#right-fit-checklist}

**CPP MSDM is a strong fit if you:**

-   Want to blend **marketing strategy + analytics**

-   Are willing to build technical comfort (measurement, dashboards, data thinking)

-   Prefer career lanes like **Marketing Data & Analytics** or the **technical side** of performance marketing

-   Want a portfolio that shows measurable outcomes and problem-solving

**You may struggle (or need a different plan) if you:**

-   Want a purely creative/content-only path and do not want to build measurement/data skills

-   Are assuming STEM automatically means easy long-term sponsorship (it does not)

## **Application Deadlines**

::: {.callout-tip title="Don't Wait until the Deadline"}
-   Deadline for Fall Admission: May 1

-   Deadline for Spring Admission: October 1

These deadlines are absolute last day the university would accept application. Meeting these deadlines, however, doesn't guarantee that you will have sufficient time for securing Visa at your country. **You should factor your home country situation in when you make application decisions**.
:::

## **Admission Decision Timeline & Implications** {#admission-decision-timeline-implications}

From the moment you submitted your application, it may take anywhere between 7 weeks to 13 weeks to hear about admissions decision. For details about **Step 1** - **Step 4**, see [Admission Decision Process, Method, and Timeline](application.qmd#admission-decision-process-method-timeline).

For international students, however, that is not the end. they have to secure I-20 and Visa.

::: {.callout-warning title="Be Very Conservative with Your Timeline"}
International students must add one more step, which is to [request I-20](https://www.cpp.edu/international/students/new-students/request-i-20.shtml) at the [International Center](https://www.cpp.edu/international/students/new-students/index.shtml). Since I am not involved in the process, I can tell you how long it would take, but both students and International Center play roles.

4.  **Step 5: Gather all the documents such as bank statements showing sufficient fund to cover your study and your passport, and submit 1-20 request form.**

5.  **Step 6: The International Center adviser assigned to you will need to process the I-20 request you submitted.**

If you could prepare Step 5 prior to Step 3 and Step 4, you can save a lot of time. **Step 6 might take about a month**. Thus, international students must add at least one month more in their timeline **(11 weeks to 17 weeks)** until they receive I-20, which is needed to be able to make an appointment for Visa interview at their own country's US Embassy or Consulate.
:::

6.  **Step 7:** **Make an Apointment for a Visa Interview.**

The processing time for **Step 7** can vary substantially depending on the demand for Visa interview at the student's home country.

::: {.callout-tip title="Timeline Simulation"}
-   Let's suppose Step 7 (Time until Visa Interview) takes about three months and your goal is to obtain your visa two months before the Fall semester begins (August 20). **How early should you start arranging for Visa interview?**

    -   You should plan to apply for your visa around March 20.

-   To get I-20 around March 20, **when should you submit your admission application package?**

    -   You should apply around **November 20 to December 20**. Because it typically takes 11–17 weeks from submitting your admission application to receiving your I-20, you should submit your program application **three to four months before** your visa application.
:::

Although the timeline above may be extreme, it illustrate the needs for international students to be proactive and plan ahead, as students have little control on the process.

## **I-20 and Visa Interview**

As soon as you are accepted into the program, contact the international office and ask them to issue you I-20, a formal document you need to apply for Visa at U.S. Embassy at your country.

If you are from country, where it takes long time to set up a Visa interview, you would be better off by applying for the MSDM and get admitted early to secure sufficient time. I have seen students from a certain reigions (e.g., South Asian countries) unable to get Visa before August when fall semester starts even if they were admitted early. You should submit probably two months prior to the deadline (May 1).
