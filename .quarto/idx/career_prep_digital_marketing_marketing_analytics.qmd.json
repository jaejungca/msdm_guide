This page is designed to help you **envision your future**, **understand the skills and tools** that will set you apart, and chart a path toward meaningful, innovative work. Whether you aspire to shape digital strategy or uncover insights through analytics, **this guide will help you build the confidence, capabilities, and direction** needed to pursue a career that makes a difference.\n\nPlease note that **coursework alone may not provide complete proficiency in every tool or skill you hope to master**. To become truly career-ready, you should make a concerted effort to train yourself beyond the classroom.\n\nTake advantage of the many extracurricular opportunities—workshops, symposiums, guest speakers, and more—offered by the ***Center for Customer Insights and Digital Marketing***, ***the MSDM Club***, and programs across the university. These experiences will deepen your learning and help you stand out in a competitive marketplace.\n:::\n\n::: callout-caution\n\nIf you plan to work in the U.S. after graduation using OPT/STEM OPT, it’s important to understand that employers often treat **short-term hiring (OPT/STEM OPT)** and **long-term sponsorship (such as H-1B)** as two separate decisions. Roles that emphasize **analytics, measurement, marketing technology, and automation** may provide more opportunities for long-term sponsorship than purely creative or generalist execution roles. See the “Guidance for International Students” section below for practical strategies and recruiter questions.\n:::\n\n# **Career Guidance for International Students** {#career-guidance-for-international-students}\n\nMany MSDM international students plan to work in the U.S. after graduation using **OPT/STEM OPT**. Because the MSDM program is STEM-designated, eligible students may have up to **3 years of work authorization** (OPT + STEM OPT). If you plan to work beyond that period, most students will eventually need an employer-supported option such as **H-1B** (or another long-term work path).\n\n## Understand the employer “lift”: OPT/STEM OPT vs. H-1B\n\nIt helps to separate two employer decisions:\n\n-   **Hiring you on OPT/STEM OPT (short-term work authorization):** Often easier for employers because you already have work authorization. (STEM OPT does add some employer requirements such as E-Verify participation and a training plan.)\n\n-   **Supporting H-1B (long-term work authorization):** Often a bigger decision because it requires legal filings, fees, and compliance—and depends on the role being a good fit for H-1B criteria.\n\n> **Bottom Line:**\n>\n> A company may be willing to hire on OPT/STEM OPT but may not be willing (or able) to support H-1B later. Treat these as **two separate questions** in your job search.\n\n## Role strategy: which digital marketing paths tend to be more “sponsorship-friendly”?\n\nSponsorship is always employer- and role-specific, but **in general**, roles with clearer “specialized skill + degree alignment” tend to have stronger sponsorship potential.\n\n-   **Marketing Data & Analytics roles (often strongest alignment)**\n\n    -   Examples: Digital Marketing Analyst, Marketing Analyst, Marketing Data Scientist\n\n    -   Why: Typically more clearly tied to specialized training (analytics, statistics, computing, experimentation).\n\n-   **Technical & Performance roles (mixed; strongest when they’re truly technical)**\n\n    -   Examples: SEO Specialist, PPC Specialist, Email/CRM Specialist\n\n    -   Why: These can become more sponsorship-aligned when the job includes **measurement, tagging, automation, data, and systems** (MarTech/CRM/analytics implementation).\n\n-   **Content & Creative roles (often more challenging for sponsorship)**\n\n    -   Examples: Social Media Manager, Content Writer, Copywriter, Designer\n\n    -   Why: These roles can be excellent careers, but employers may view many of them as more generalist, and sponsorship is often less common in smaller orgs/agencies that hire heavily in these areas.\n\n> For more about job roles above and guidance for international students, visit [Typical Job Roles in Digital Marketing](career_outlook_salary_digital_marketing.qmd#typical-job-titles).\n\n## Skills that increase sponsorship odds (add under each role group)\n\nThese are practical “signals” students can build into coursework, projects, and portfolios.\n\n**Content & Creative — skills to stand out**\n\n-   Portfolio with measurable outcomes (CTR, engagement growth, conversions)\n\n-   SEO fundamentals + basic GA4 reporting\n\n-   Light data skills: Excel/Sheets, simple dashboards, A/B test mindset\n\n**Technical & Performance — skills that move you into the “more sponsor-friendly” zone**\n\n-   SQL (even basic) + GA4 + tag management (GTM)\n\n-   Marketing automation/CRM tooling (HubSpot, Marketo, Salesforce Marketing Cloud)\n\n-   Experimentation and reporting (lift tests, conversion tracking, attribution basics)\n\n**Marketing Data & Analytics — strongest sponsor signal skills**\n\n-   SQL + Python/R + statistics/experiment design\n\n-   BI tools (Tableau/Power BI/Looker) + data storytelling\n\n-   Forecasting/marketing mix modeling/measurement frameworks\n\n## How to ask recruiters the right question (script)\n\nUse a direct, professional line that separates OPT from long-term sponsorship:\n\n> “I’m authorized to work on OPT/STEM OPT after graduation. Does your company also support work visa sponsorship (H-1B or other) for this role family?”\n\nGood follow-ups (optional):\n\n-   “Have you sponsored for this role type before (analytics / marketing ops / data)?”\n\n-   “Is your policy different by role, team, or location?”\n\n-   “If sponsorship is possible, when do you typically start the process?”\n\n## How to align your curriculum with long-term U.S. work goals\n\nIf your top priority is maximizing long-term work options, students are often best served by:\n\n-   Choosing **Marketing Analytics** emphasis, **or**\n\n-   Choosing a **Balanced/Mixed** path **but intentionally building technical depth** (SQL, analytics implementation, automation, experimentation, BI).\n\n> If you prefer **Digital Marketing Strategy**, you can still succeed—just be intentional about adding “specialized” signals through projects (measurement, experiments, dashboards, technical tooling) so your profile isn’t purely generalist.\n>\n> For more details about how to align your curriculum with your long-term employment in the U.S., please see [**VISA Status (Domestic vs. International Students)**](curriculum_contract#visa-status-domestic-vs.-international-students) **section.**\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Summary & Conclusion:\n\nMany MSDM international students plan to work in the U.S. using OPT/STEM OPT after graduation. While OPT/STEM OPT provides work authorization for a limited period, continuing to work in the U.S. longer-term may require an employer-supported option (often H-1B or another pathway). Because employers may be willing to hire on OPT/STEM OPT but not pursue sponsorship later, international students should be especially intentional about (1) targeting role families with stronger sponsorship patterns (often **analytics** and more technical **performance/MarTech** roles), (2) building a portfolio that demonstrates specialized, degree-linked skills (e.g., **SQL, experimentation, dashboards, automation**), and (3) asking recruiters early whether the company supports sponsorship for the role.\n:::\n\n::: callout-warning\n## Disclaimer\n\n*This is general career guidance, not legal advice. Visa options and sponsorship decisions depend on the employer, the job description, and current regulations.*\n:::\n\n# **Skills Employers Look for in Digital Marketing Roles** {#skills-and-knowledge-for-dms-careers}\n\n## Core Digital Marketing Skills\n\nEmployers expect a strong grounding in marketing principles + digital execution:\n\n-   **SEO/SEM**: Keyword research, on-page SEO, technical SEO, Google Ads.\n\n-   **Content Marketing**: Strategy, writing, optimizing for engagement & conversions.\n\n-   **Social Media Marketing**: Paid/organic campaigns across platforms, audience targeting.\n\n-   **Email Marketing & CRM**: Segmentation, A/B testing, lifecycle campaigns.\n\n-   **Performance Marketing**: Paid search, display, social ads, ROI optimization.\n\n-   **Marketing Automation**: HubSpot, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Marketo, etc.\n\n-   **Campaign Analytics**: Attribution models, funnel analysis, ROI tracking.\n\n## Analytics & Data Skills\n\nThis is where **R, Python, SQL, and BI tools** give candidates a big edge:\n\n-   **Data Wrangling & Analysis**: SQL (databases), R/Python for data cleaning and modeling.\n\n-   **Web & Campaign Analytics**: Google Analytics 4 (GA4), Tag Manager, Looker Studio.\n\n-   **Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)** & Attribution: Understanding how channels drive results.\n\n-   **A/B Testing & Experimentation**: Experimental design, statistical analysis.\n\n-   **Customer Analytics**: Segmentation, lifetime value prediction, churn modeling.\n\n-   **Forecasting**: Time-series forecasting of sales, demand, or campaign KPIs.\n\n-   **Dashboarding & Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI, R Shiny, or Quarto for storytelling.\n\n-   **Big Data Tools** (nice-to-have): Working with APIs, warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake), Arrow/duckdb for large datasets.\n\n## Tech & Emerging Tools\n\n-   **Quarto / RMarkdown**: Reproducible reports & documentation.\n\n-   **Machine Learning Basics**: Predictive modeling, recommendation systems (entry-level knowledge is often enough for marketing roles).\n\n-   **AI for Marketing**: Understanding how GenAI is applied to content creation, personalization, and customer insights.\n\n## Business & Soft Skills\n\nThis often makes or breaks candidates:\n\n-   **Storytelling with Data**: Translating analytics into business recommendations.\n\n-   **Project Management**: Agile workflows, cross-team collaboration.\n\n-   **Communication**: Explaining technical insights to non-technical stakeholders.\n\n-   **Problem Solving**: Turning ambiguous marketing challenges into testable, data-driven solutions.\n\n-   **Commercial Awareness**: Understanding ROI, CAC, CLV, and KPIs that matter to business leaders.\n\n## Skill Bundles by Role Type\n\nTo help your students target **different flavors of digital marketing roles**:\n\n-   **Digital Marketing Analyst / Data Scientist**\n    -   SQL, R/Python, A/B testing, MMM, GA4, dashboarding.\n-   **Performance Marketing Specialist**\n    -   Paid ads, GA4, attribution, campaign optimization, Excel/SQL.\n-   **Marketing Automation / CRM Specialist**\n    -   Email automation tools, segmentation, lifecycle marketing, A/B testing.\n-   **Growth Marketer**\n    -   Blend of analytics + campaign execution + experimentation mindset.\n-   **Digital Marketing Manager (strategic)**\n    -   Team leadership, vendor management, high-level analytics (dashboards, ROI tracking).\n\n::: callout-important\n### 👉 **Bottom Line:**\n\nEmployers want **marketers who can work with data**. Even if they’re not “full data scientists,” knowing **SQL + R/Python basics + GA4 + A/B testing** gives them a **big competitive edge** in digital marketing roles. Pair that with **strong storytelling and business impact communication**, and they’re highly employable.\n:::\n\n## Social Media Marketing Managers & Content Creators\n\n### Core skills they **must have**:\n\n-   **Platform expertise**: Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube, X (ads + organic).\n\n-   **Content strategy**: Matching brand voice with platform audience.\n\n-   **Creative skills**: Copywriting, design tools (Canva, Adobe suite), short-form video.\n\n-   **Community management**: Engaging audiences, managing comments, brand reputation.\n\n-   **Campaign performance**: Reading dashboards (reach, engagement, CTR, conversions).\n\n### Data skills (nice-to-have, but not the core):\n\n-   **Basic analytics literacy**:\n    -   Understanding metrics (CTR, engagement rate, conversion rate, ROAS).\n\n    -   A/B testing creatives (e.g., which ad copy/video works better).\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **Intermediate (optional, career-boosting)**:\n    -   SQL/R/Python not essential, but *helpful* if they want to grow into a broader analytics or digital marketing manager role.\n\n    -   Knowing how to pull performance data from APIs (e.g., Meta Ads, Google Ads) is a differentiator, but not expected for most content roles.\n\n::: callout-important\n### 👉 **Bottom line**:\n\nSMMs and content creators don’t need deep DBI/dbplyr/Arrow-level skills. They need to be *data-aware* — capable of interpreting dashboards and making creative/strategy decisions from them.\n:::\n\n## Digital Marketing Managers\n\n### Core expectations:\n\n-   **Strategic oversight** of campaigns across channels (search, social, display, email, web).\n\n-   **Budget management**: Allocating spend across channels for ROI.\n\n-   **Team coordination**: Overseeing content, social, analytics, and performance specialists.\n\n-   **Vendor/agency management**: Communicating expectations and results.\n\n### Data skills (increasingly important):\n\n-   **Definitely needed**:\n    -   Comfort with **dashboards** (GA4, Looker Studio, Tableau, Power BI).\n\n    -   Ability to interpret **attribution reports** (which channels drive conversions).\n\n    -   Understanding **MMM outputs** or campaign lift studies (even if they don’t build the models).\n\n    -   Running/overseeing **A/B tests** (e.g., subject lines, ad targeting).\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **Not always required**:\n    -   Hands-on SQL/R/Python isn’t required in every company — but managers who can *at least query a database or validate results* have a strong edge.\n\n    -   In larger organizations, they’ll work with analysts who do the heavy lifting.\n\n    -   In startups/lean teams, managers often do both **strategy + basic analytics**, so SQL/Excel may be expected.\n\n::: callout-tip\n👉 **Bottom line**:\n\nDigital Marketing Managers *must* be **data-literate** (able to interpret and act on analytics). They don’t always need to *code models themselves*, but they need to **manage data-driven decision-making**. If they aspire to higher-level performance or growth roles, learning **SQL** and analytics basics is a significant advantage.\n:::\n\n## Practical Advice for Students\n\n-   **Content/Social-focused careers** → Prioritize creative skills, platform mastery, and *basic* analytics literacy.\n\n-   **Managerial/strategic careers** → Prioritize **data literacy** and decision-making with data. Hands-on coding isn’t always mandatory, but understanding the outputs of analytics (MMM, attribution, segmentation) is critical.\n\n::: callout-caution\n### 👉 Do They Need Analytics?\n\n-   **Social media managers & content creators** don’t need deep data science skills — dashboards and campaign analytics literacy are enough.\n\n-   **Digital marketing managers** *do* need stronger data skills (not necessarily coding, but strong analytics interpretation). Those who can bridge **creativity + analytics** are the ones who move up fastest.\n:::\n\n## Social Media Manager vs. Digital Marketing Manager vs. Marketing Data Scientist\n\n+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Role                          | Core Skills & Responsibilities                                    | Data Skills & Tools (Required / Nice-to-Have)                              |\n+===============================+===================================================================+============================================================================+\n| **Social Media Manager**      | -   Content creation, copywriting, design (video/images)          | -   Interpreting engagement metrics (reach, likes, CTR)                    |\n|                               | -   Community engagement and customer service                     | -   Basic analytics (built-in platform dashboards)                         |\n|                               | -   Trend awareness & adaptability                                | -   Data storytelling and reporting[^1]                                    |\n|                               | -   Strategic campaign planning                                   |                                                                            |\n+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| **Digital Marketing Manager** | -   Campaign strategy across channels                             | -   Interpreting attribution models, MMM outputs, A/B test results         |\n|                               |                                                                   |                                                                            |\n|                               | -   Budgeting and ROI focus                                       | -   Dashboard literacy (GA4, Looker Studio, Tableau/Power BI)              |\n|                               |                                                                   |                                                                            |\n|                               | -   Leadership and vendor coordination                            | -   (Optional) ability to query data/SQL for validation[^2] [^3]           |\n|                               |                                                                   |                                                                            |\n|                               | -   Multichannel storytelling                                     |                                                                            |\n+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| **Marketing Data Scientist**  | -   Advanced modeling: MMM, CRM, churn, forecasting, segmentation | -   Hands-on with SQL, R/Python                                            |\n|                               |                                                                   |                                                                            |\n|                               | -   Analytical experimentation (A/B tests, lift studies)          | -   Database interfacing, data warehouses, Parquet/Arrow, dbplyr pipelines |\n|                               |                                                                   |                                                                            |\n|                               | -   Translating insights into strategy                            | -   Building dashboards or Shiny/Quarto reports (optional)                 |\n+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n[^1]: <https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-skills/?utm_source=chatgpt.com>\n\n[^2]: <https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/blog/8-skills-you-need-to-become-a-digital-marketing-manager?utm_source=chatgpt.com>\n\n[^3]: <https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/careers/news/6-skills-that-can-give-you-an-edge-in-the-us-job-market/articleshow/123549861.cms?utm_source=chatgpt.com>\n\n## Role-by-Role Insights:\n\n### **Social Media Managers & Content Creators**\n\n-   They need to be **creative, adaptive, and engaging**—focused on content + community.

**Marketing Analysts and Marketing Data Scientists: Skills and Knowledge** {#skills-and-knowledge-for-analytics-careers}\n\n## Career Preparations for Marketing Analytics Career\n\nData science jobs tailored for marketing is different from regular data science jobs or business analytics. Which tools should you be familiar with?\n\n### **R is absolutely a marketable skill, but Python often gives an edge**\n\n-   **R strengths**: It’s fantastic for statistics, econometrics, experimental design, marketing mix modeling, and survey data analysis—all things marketing analysts and data scientists need. Many marketing and social science–oriented companies (consultancies, CPG, ad-tech, agencies) rely on R.\n\n-   **Python strengths**: It dominates in machine learning engineering, AI, data pipelines, and production-level work. If the job involves deploying models at scale or working closely with engineers, Python is usually the standard.\n\n### **Employers care about the *core skills***\n\n-   Knowing **how to design experiments, analyze consumer data, build predictive models, interpret insights, and communicate recommendations** matters more than the specific tool.\n\n-   If you can demonstrate strong knowledge in data wrangling, modeling, visualization, and storytelling, you’re employable—whether in R, Python, or even SQL + BI tools.\n\n### **Bridging R to the job market**\n\n-   **For analytics-heavy roles (marketing research, econometrics, MMM, A/B testing, segmentation, customer insights):** R is more than enough.\n\n-   **For ML/AI-heavy roles (recommendation systems, NLP on consumer text, computer vision for ad content):** You’ll likely need Python.\n\n### **What I’d recommend to them**\n\n-   **Get excellent at R first.** Become fluent in tidyverse, modeling packages, and reporting (e.g., RMarkdown/Shiny).\n\n-   **Pick up Python basics** along the way (especially pandas, scikit-learn, maybe TensorFlow/PyTorch if they’re ambitious). Even if they’re not fluent, just showing “working knowledge” reduces employer concerns.\n\n-   **Always highlight transferable skills.** Frame your résumé and interviews around what you can *do* with data (segmentation, predictive models, campaign optimization), not just which software you use.\n\n::: callout-tip\n### 👉 So the bottom line to students would be:\n\nYes, you can be job-ready with just R for many marketing analytics and data science roles. But if you want to maximize opportunities—especially in ML-heavy or tech-company contexts—adding at least s**ome Python competency** will make you more competitive.\n:::\n\n## Marketing Data Scientist Job-Readiness Roadmap\n\n### **Core Analytics & Marketing Knowledge**\n\n-   Be able to **frame business problems as data problems**\n\n-   A/B testing & experimental design (campaign testing, website optimization)\n\n-   Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) / attribution models\n\n-   Customer segmentation & clustering\n\n-   Lifetime value prediction & churn analysis\n\n-   Price elasticity and promotion lift modeling\n\n### **Programming & Tools**\n\n-   Must-Have\n\n    -   **R (strong foundation)**\n\n        -   Data wrangling: `dplyr`, `tidyr`\n\n        -   Visualization: `ggplot2`, `plotly`\n\n        -   Modeling: `caret`, `tidymodels`, `lavaan` (SEM), `forecast`/`prophet`\n\n        -   Reporting: `RMarkdown`, `Shiny`\n\n    -   **SQL**\n\n        -   Querying large marketing/customer databases\n\n        -   Joins, aggregations, window functions\n\n-   Nice-to-Have (to maximize opportunities)\n\n    -   **Python (working knowledge)**\n\n        -   `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn` for predictive modeling\n\n        -   Optional: `tensorflow/pytorch` for deep learning if going ML-heavy\n\n    -   **BI Tools**: Tableau or PowerBI (business-facing dashboards)\n\n### **Math & Stats Foundation**\n\n-   Regression (linear, logistic, regularized)\n\n-   Hypothesis testing, ANOVA, chi-square\n\n-   Bayesian inference (useful for MMM & A/B testing)\n\n-   Time series forecasting\n\n### **Business & Storytelling Skills**\n\n-   Turning statistical outputs into **marketing recommendations**\n\n-   Visualization for non-technical stakeholders\n\n-   Writing **executive-friendly reports** (e.g., “Campaign X lifted ROI by 12%”)\n\n-   Communicating uncertainty and trade-offs\n\n### **Portfolio Project Ideas (Show Employers!)**\n\nEncourage students to **publish on GitHub + LinkedIn**:\n\n1.  **Marketing Mix Model (MMM)** on simulated data — estimate ROI of channels\n\n2.  **Customer Segmentation** with clustering (K-means / hierarchical / mixture models)\n\n3.  **A/B Test Simulation** — show how to design, analyze, and interpret results\n\n4.  **Customer Churn Prediction** — build a classification model from CRM data\n\n5.  **Sentiment Analysis** on customer reviews or social media (Python-friendly add-on)\n\n6.  **Interactive Dashboard** (R Shiny or Tableau) for campaign performance\n\n### **Job Search Positioning**\n\n-   Frame yourself as: **“I use data to optimize marketing decisions and drive ROI.”**\n\n-   Tailor résumé to highlight:\n\n    -   Tools: R, SQL, some Python\n\n    -   Skills: A/B testing, MMM, segmentation, forecasting, churn prediction\n\n    -   Communication: dashboards, storytelling\n\n### Final Advice\n\n-   **Yes, R is enough** to get into analytics-heavy roles.\n\n-   **Python basics** unlock ML/AI-heavy roles (tech firms, ad-tech, recommendation systems).\n\n-   Employers don’t hire tools—they hire **problem solvers who can generate insights from data**.\n\n## What is Positron?\n\n**Positron** is a free, next-generation data science IDE from Posit (formerly RStudio) that supports both **Python and R** natively—it’s designed for polyglot workflows. It’s built on the open-source **Code OSS** (the foundation of VS Code) and brings a modern, extensible environment tailored for data work\n\n**Key features include:**\n\n-   **Variable & Data Frame Explorer**: Explore, filter, sort, and summarize your data interactively\n\n-   **Multi‑Session Console**: Run R and Python code in parallel, each in separate consoles, without modifying your source files\n\n-   **Interpreter & Environment Management**: Easily switch between different R and Python environments\n\n-   **Polished UI & AI Assistance**: Includes a modern editor with support for VSIX extensions and the Positron Assistant for contextual AI-based help\n\n-   **Database Connection Pane**: Built-in support for browsing and querying SQL data sources directly within the IDE\n\n-   **Integrated Data App Workflow**: Launch and debug Shiny, Streamlit, Dash, or FastAPI apps with a single click\n\n### How Does It Compare to RStudio for Data Warehouse Integration?\n\nRStudio remains a highly stable and familiar environment for R work, especially in statistical modeling and reproducible reporting with R Markdown or Quarto. However, when it comes to interfacing with data warehouses—typically SQL-heavy work—Positron offers distinct advantages:\n\n-   **Advantages of Positron:**\n\n    1.  **Built-In SQL Integration**: The Database Connection Pane lets users connect to and query SQL data sources right inside the IDE, making data-access streamlined.\n\n    2.  **Polyglot Workflow**: For teams or students who may use both R and Python for ETL, modeling, or automation, Positron lets them do so in one session—no context-switching needed.\n\n    3.  **Modern, Customizable UI**: Being based on VS Code, Positron supports a wide ecosystem of extensions, customizable layout, and flexible workflows\n\n-   Things to Keep in Mind:\n\n    -   **Active Development**: Positron is still relatively new and under active development. Some features familiar from RStudio—like inline output in Quarto documents, workspace autosave on restart, history pane, and RStudio Add-ins—are not yet fully implemented.\n\n    -   **Learning Curve**: Switching from RStudio may take some onboarding time, especially for users accustomed to its tightly integrated interface\n\n    -   **Foundation**: RStudio continues to be maintained with a focus on stability, especially for R-heavy workflows. Positron is additive, not a replacement\n\n### Judgment Call: Is Positron Better for Data Warehouse Workflows?\n\n**Yes—especially for workflows involving SQL or dual-language environments.** Here’s why:\n\n-   The built-in SQL pane and query tools make accessing warehouse data naturally part of the coding workflow.\n\n-   Students can seamlessly move between R and Python, which many real-world jobs require.\n\n-   The VS Code-based engine makes Positron extensible, customizable, and future-facing.\n\nThat said, if the student is focused primarily on R and relies heavily on RMarkdown, Addins, or a very streamlined R-focused workflow, RStudio may still feel more polished.\n\n## Recommendation for Marketing Data Science Tools\n\n-   **For SQL-heavy, polyglot, or app-deployment workflows**: Experiment with **Positron**. Its features align well with modern data engineering and analytics workflows.\n\n-   **For R-focused, academic, or reproducibility-heavy tasks**: **RStudio** remains excellent and highly reliable—especially for teaching foundations in R.\n\n### What to install (minimum viable setup)\n\n1.  **R in VS Code**\n\n    -   Extension: **“R” (REditorSupport)** — consoles, data viewer, plots pane, workspace browser, debugging, Rmd support. ([Visual Studio Marketplace;](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r&utm_source=chatgpt.com \"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=reditorsupport.r&utm_source=chatgpt.com\")[Visual Studio Code;](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r?utm_source=chatgpt.com\")[GitHub.](https://github.com/REditorSupport/vscode-R?search=1&utm_source=chatgpt.com \"https://github.com/reditorsupport/vscode-r?search=1&utm_source=chatgpt.com\"))\n\n    -   Helpful bits:\n\n        -   `languageserver` for IDE features (autocomplete, linting). ([jozef.io](https://jozef.io/r300-language-server-setup/?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"https://jozef.io/r300-language-server-setup/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\"))\n\n        -   `httpgd` for a great plot viewer (enable “R: Plot: Use httpgd”). Note: currently installed from GitHub. ([Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52284345/how-to-show-r-graph-from-visual-studio-code?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52284345/how-to-show-r-graph-from-visual-studio-code?utm_source=chatgpt.com\"))\n\n2.  **Quarto**\n\n    -   Install Quarto CLI, then VS Code **“Quarto”** extension for render/preview and project workflows (websites/books).\n\n3.  **Python**\n\n    -   Extensions: **Python**, **Pylance**, and **Jupyter** (first-class support; active monthly releases; new dedicated **Python Environments** panel rolling out). ([Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python&utm_source=chatgpt.com \"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=ms-python.python&utm_source=chatgpt.com\"); [Microsoft for Developers+1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-july-2025-release/?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-july-2025-release/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\"); [Visual Studio Magazine](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2025/08/18/dedicated-python-environments-tool-rolls-out-in-vs-code-update.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2025/08/18/dedicated-python-environments-tool-rolls-out-in-vs-code-update.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com\"))\n\n### Connecting to data warehouses (three good paths)\n\n1.  **Pure SQL inside VS Code**\n\n    -   Use **SQLTools** plus the driver for your warehouse (Snowflake, Databricks, Postgres, etc.) to browse schemas and run queries inline.\n\n    -   Examples:\n\n        -   **Snowflake** VS Code extension (SQL + Snowpark integration).\n\n        -   **Databricks** driver for SQLTools (query SQL Warehouses directly).\n\n    -   FYI for Microsoft stacks: Azure Data Studio is being retired in 2026; Microsoft recommends moving to VS Code + SQL extensions. [Microsoft LearnLinks to an external site.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/whats-happening-azure-data-studio?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/whats-happening-azure-data-studio?utm_source=chatgpt.com\")\n\n2.  **R + DBI/odbc from your code**\n\n    -   Use **DBI** with **odbc** (or backend-specific drivers like `RPostgres`, `bigrquery`) and optionally `dbplyr` to write dplyr that translates to SQL.\n\n3.  **C. Python from your code**\n\n    -   Use **SQLAlchemy**, **pyodbc**, **snowflake-snowpark-python**, or **databricks-sql-connector** within VS Code’s Python/Jupyter workflow (extensions above cover environments and notebooks). (General pattern supported by the Python/Jupyter extensions.)\n\n### VS Code vs. Positron vs. RStudio (for your use case)\n\n-   **VS Code**: Most mature **polyglot** environment today; deep SQL tooling; constant releases; huge extension ecosystem (including Quarto). Great when students mix R, Python, and warehouse SQL.\n\n-   **Positron**: Promising R+Python IDE from Posit with data/variable explorer and SQL pane, but still maturing; some RStudio niceties aren’t fully there yet. If you need “ready today” for warehousing, VS Code wins on stability and breadth. (Context: Positron pages highlight active development and gaps vs RStudio.)\n\n-   **RStudio**: Still superb for **R-first** teaching (R Markdown/Quarto, tidyverse, Shiny) but not as strong for multi-language + warehouse dev as VS Code’s ecosystem.\n\n### Bottom line\n\nIf Positron feels a bit early for you right now, **VS Code is the best “bridge”**: rock-solid for **R + Quarto + Python** and excellent for **data-warehouse** workflows via SQLTools/warehouse extensions or via DBI/odbc inside your code. It’s a great environment to standardize on for your cohort this year.\n\n# **Marketing Analysts vs. Marketing Data Scientists: Comparisons**\n\n## Career Preparations for Marketing Analytics

Roles that emphasize **analytics, measurement, marketing technology, and automation** may provide more opportunities for long-term sponsorship than purely creative or generalist execution roles. See the “Guidance for International Students” section below for practical strategies and recruiter questions.\n:::\n\n# **Career Guidance for International Students** {#career-guidance-for-international-students}\n\nMany MSDM international students plan to work in the U.S. after graduation using **OPT/STEM OPT**. Because the MSDM program is STEM-designated, eligible students may have up to **3 years of work authorization** (OPT + STEM OPT). If you plan to work beyond that period, most students will eventually need an employer-supported option such as **H-1B** (or another long-term work path).\n\n## Understand the employer “lift”: OPT/STEM OPT vs. H-1B\n\nIt helps to separate two employer decisions:\n\n-   **Hiring you on OPT/STEM OPT (short-term work authorization):** Often easier for employers because you already have work authorization. (STEM OPT does add some employer requirements such as E-Verify participation and a training plan.)\n\n-   **Supporting H-1B (long-term work authorization):** Often a bigger decision because it requires legal filings, fees, and compliance—and depends on the role being a good fit for H-1B criteria.\n\n> **Bottom Line:**\n>\n> A company may be willing to hire on OPT/STEM OPT but may not be willing (or able) to support H-1B later. Treat these as **two separate questions** in your job search.\n\n## Role strategy: which digital marketing paths tend to be more “sponsorship-friendly”?\n\nSponsorship is always employer- and role-specific, but **in general**, roles with clearer “specialized skill + degree alignment” tend to have stronger sponsorship potential.\n\n-   **Marketing Data & Analytics roles (often strongest alignment)**\n\n    -   Examples: Digital Marketing Analyst, Marketing Analyst, Marketing Data Scientist\n\n    -   Why: Typically more clearly tied to specialized training (analytics, statistics, computing, experimentation).\n\n-   **Technical & Performance roles (mixed; strongest when they’re truly technical)**\n\n    -   Examples: SEO Specialist, PPC Specialist, Email/CRM Specialist\n\n    -   Why: These can become more sponsorship-aligned when the job includes **measurement, tagging, automation, data, and systems** (MarTech/CRM/analytics implementation).\n\n-   **Content & Creative roles (often more challenging for sponsorship)**\n\n    -   Examples: Social Media Manager, Content Writer, Copywriter, Designer\n\n    -   Why: These roles can be excellent careers, but employers may view many of them as more generalist, and sponsorship is often less common in smaller orgs/agencies that hire heavily in these areas.\n\n> For more about job roles above and guidance for international students, visit [Typical Job Roles in Digital Marketing](career_outlook_salary_digital_marketing.qmd#typical-job-titles).\n\n## Skills that increase sponsorship odds (add under each role group)\n\nThese are practical “signals” students can build into coursework, projects, and portfolios.\n\n**Content & Creative — skills to stand out**\n\n-   Portfolio with measurable outcomes (CTR, engagement growth, conversions)\n\n-   SEO fundamentals + basic GA4 reporting\n\n-   Light data skills: Excel/Sheets, simple dashboards, A/B test mindset\n\n**Technical & Performance — skills that move you into the “more sponsor-friendly” zone**\n\n-   SQL (even basic) + GA4 + tag management (GTM)\n\n-   Marketing automation/CRM tooling (HubSpot, Marketo, Salesforce Marketing Cloud)\n\n-   Experimentation and reporting (lift tests, conversion tracking, attribution basics)\n\n**Marketing Data & Analytics — strongest sponsor signal skills**\n\n-   SQL + Python/R + statistics/experiment design\n\n-   BI tools (Tableau/Power BI/Looker) + data storytelling\n\n-   Forecasting/marketing mix modeling/measurement frameworks\n\n## How to ask recruiters the right question (script)\n\nUse a direct, professional line that separates OPT from long-term sponsorship:\n\n> “I’m authorized to work on OPT/STEM OPT after graduation. Does your company also support work visa sponsorship (H-1B or other) for this role family?”\n\nGood follow-ups (optional):\n\n-   “Have you sponsored for this role type before (analytics / marketing ops / data)?”\n\n-   “Is your policy different by role, team, or location?”\n\n-   “If sponsorship is possible, when do you typically start the process?”\n\n## How to align your curriculum with long-term U.S. work goals\n\nIf your top priority is maximizing long-term work options, students are often best served by:\n\n-   Choosing **Marketing Analytics** emphasis, **or**\n\n-   Choosing a **Balanced/Mixed** path **but intentionally building technical depth** (SQL, analytics implementation, automation, experimentation, BI).\n\n> If you prefer **Digital Marketing Strategy**, you can still succeed—just be intentional about adding “specialized” signals through projects (measurement, experiments, dashboards, technical tooling) so your profile isn’t purely generalist.\n>\n> For more details about how to align your curriculum with your long-term employment in the U.S., please see [**VISA Status (Domestic vs. International Students)**](curriculum_contract#visa-status-domestic-vs.-international-students) **section.**\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Summary & Conclusion:\n\nMany MSDM international students plan to work in the U.S. using OPT/STEM OPT after graduation. While OPT/STEM OPT provides work authorization for a limited period, continuing to work in the U.S. longer-term may require an employer-supported option (often H-1B or another pathway). Because employers may be willing to hire on OPT/STEM OPT but not pursue sponsorship later, international students should be especially intentional about (1) targeting role families with stronger sponsorship patterns (often **analytics** and more technical **performance/MarTech** roles), (2) building a portfolio that demonstrates specialized, degree-linked skills (e.g., **SQL, experimentation, dashboards, automation**), and (3) asking recruiters early whether the company supports sponsorship for the role.\n:::\n\n::: callout-warning\n## Disclaimer\n\n*This is general career guidance, not legal advice.

Pair that with **strong storytelling and business impact communication**, and they’re highly employable.\n:::\n\n## Social Media Marketing Managers & Content Creators\n\n### Core skills they **must have**:\n\n-   **Platform expertise**: Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube, X (ads + organic).\n\n-   **Content strategy**: Matching brand voice with platform audience.\n\n-   **Creative skills**: Copywriting, design tools (Canva, Adobe suite), short-form video.\n\n-   **Community management**: Engaging audiences, managing comments, brand reputation.\n\n-   **Campaign performance**: Reading dashboards (reach, engagement, CTR, conversions).\n\n### Data skills (nice-to-have, but not the core):\n\n-   **Basic analytics literacy**:\n    -   Understanding metrics (CTR, engagement rate, conversion rate, ROAS).\n\n    -   A/B testing creatives (e.g., which ad copy/video works better).\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **Intermediate (optional, career-boosting)**:\n    -   SQL/R/Python not essential, but *helpful* if they want to grow into a broader analytics or digital marketing manager role.\n\n    -   Knowing how to pull performance data from APIs (e.g., Meta Ads, Google Ads) is a differentiator, but not expected for most content roles.\n\n::: callout-important\n### 👉 **Bottom line**:\n\nSMMs and content creators don’t need deep DBI/dbplyr/Arrow-level skills. They need to be *data-aware* — capable of interpreting dashboards and making creative/strategy decisions from them.\n:::\n\n## Digital Marketing Managers\n\n### Core expectations:\n\n-   **Strategic oversight** of campaigns across channels (search, social, display, email, web).\n\n-   **Budget management**: Allocating spend across channels for ROI.\n\n-   **Team coordination**: Overseeing content, social, analytics, and performance specialists.\n\n-   **Vendor/agency management**: Communicating expectations and results.\n\n### Data skills (increasingly important):\n\n-   **Definitely needed**:\n    -   Comfort with **dashboards** (GA4, Looker Studio, Tableau, Power BI).\n\n    -   Ability to interpret **attribution reports** (which channels drive conversions).\n\n    -   Understanding **MMM outputs** or campaign lift studies (even if they don’t build the models).\n\n    -   Running/overseeing **A/B tests** (e.g., subject lines, ad targeting).\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **Not always required**:\n    -   Hands-on SQL/R/Python isn’t required in every company — but managers who can *at least query a database or validate results* have a strong edge.\n\n    -   In larger organizations, they’ll work with analysts who do the heavy lifting.\n\n    -   In startups/lean teams, managers often do both **strategy + basic analytics**, so SQL/Excel may be expected.\n\n::: callout-tip\n👉 **Bottom line**:\n\nDigital Marketing Managers *must* be **data-literate** (able to interpret and act on analytics). They don’t always need to *code models themselves*, but they need to **manage data-driven decision-making**. If they aspire to higher-level performance or growth roles, learning **SQL** and analytics basics is a significant advantage.\n:::\n\n## Practical Advice for Students\n\n-   **Content/Social-focused careers** → Prioritize creative skills, platform mastery, and *basic* analytics literacy.\n\n-   **Managerial/strategic careers** → Prioritize **data literacy** and decision-making with data. Hands-on coding isn’t always mandatory, but understanding the outputs of analytics (MMM, attribution, segmentation) is critical.\n\n::: callout-caution\n### 👉 Do They Need Analytics?\n\n-   **Social media managers & content creators** don’t need deep data science skills — dashboards and campaign analytics literacy are enough.\n\n-   **Digital marketing managers** *do* need stronger data skills (not necessarily coding, but strong analytics interpretation). Those who can bridge **creativity + analytics** are the ones who move up fastest.\n:::\n\n## Social Media Manager vs. Digital Marketing Manager vs. Marketing Data Scientist\n\n+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Role                          | Core Skills & Responsibilities                                    | Data Skills & Tools (Required / Nice-to-Have)                              |\n+===============================+===================================================================+============================================================================+\n| **Social Media Manager**      | -   Content creation, copywriting, design (video/images)          | -   Interpreting engagement metrics (reach, likes, CTR)                    |\n|                               | -   Community engagement and customer service                     | -   Basic analytics (built-in platform dashboards)                         |\n|                               | -   Trend awareness & adaptability                                | -   Data storytelling and reporting[^1]                                    |\n|                               | -   Strategic campaign planning                                   |                                                                            |\n+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| **Digital Marketing Manager** | -   Campaign strategy across channels                             | -   Interpreting attribution models, MMM outputs, A/B test results         |\n|                               |                                                                   |                                                                            |\n|                               | -   Budgeting and ROI focus                                       | -   Dashboard literacy (GA4, Looker Studio, Tableau/Power BI)              |\n|                               |                                                                   |                                                                            |\n|                               | -   Leadership and vendor coordination                            | -   (Optional) ability to query data/SQL for validation[^2] [^3]           |\n|                               |                                                                   |                                                                            |\n|                               | -   Multichannel storytelling                                     |                                                                            |\n+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| **Marketing Data Scientist**  | -   Advanced modeling: MMM, CRM, churn, forecasting, segmentation | -   Hands-on with SQL, R/Python                                            |\n|                               |                                                                   |                                                                            |\n|                               | -   Analytical experimentation (A/B tests, lift studies)          | -   Database interfacing, data warehouses, Parquet/Arrow, dbplyr pipelines |\n|                               |                                                                   |                                                                            |\n|                               | -   Translating insights into strategy                            | -   Building dashboards or Shiny/Quarto reports (optional)                 |\n+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n[^1]: <https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-skills/?utm_source=chatgpt.com>\n\n[^2]: <https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/blog/8-skills-you-need-to-become-a-digital-marketing-manager?utm_source=chatgpt.com>\n\n[^3]: <https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/careers/news/6-skills-that-can-give-you-an-edge-in-the-us-job-market/articleshow/123549861.cms?utm_source=chatgpt.com>\n\n## Role-by-Role Insights:\n\n### **Social Media Managers & Content Creators**\n\n-   They need to be **creative, adaptive, and engaging**—focused on content + community.

**Marketing Analysts and Marketing Data Scientists: Skills and Knowledge** {#skills-and-knowledge-for-analytics-careers}\n\n## Career Preparations for Marketing Analytics Career\n\nData science jobs tailored for marketing is different from regular data science jobs or business analytics. Which tools should you be familiar with?\n\n### **R is absolutely a marketable skill, but Python often gives an edge**\n\n-   **R strengths**: It’s fantastic for statistics, econometrics, experimental design, marketing mix modeling, and survey data analysis—all things marketing analysts and data scientists need. Many marketing and social science–oriented companies (consultancies, CPG, ad-tech, agencies) rely on R.\n\n-   **Python strengths**: It dominates in machine learning engineering, AI, data pipelines, and production-level work. If the job involves deploying models at scale or working closely with engineers, Python is usually the standard.\n\n### **Employers care about the *core skills***\n\n-   Knowing **how to design experiments, analyze consumer data, build predictive models, interpret insights, and communicate recommendations** matters more than the specific tool.\n\n-   If you can demonstrate strong knowledge in data wrangling, modeling, visualization, and storytelling, you’re employable—whether in R, Python, or even SQL + BI tools.\n\n### **Bridging R to the job market**\n\n-   **For analytics-heavy roles (marketing research, econometrics, MMM, A/B testing, segmentation, customer insights):** R is more than enough.\n\n-   **For ML/AI-heavy roles (recommendation systems, NLP on consumer text, computer vision for ad content):** You’ll likely need Python.\n\n### **What I’d recommend to them**\n\n-   **Get excellent at R first.** Become fluent in tidyverse, modeling packages, and reporting (e.g., RMarkdown/Shiny).\n\n-   **Pick up Python basics** along the way (especially pandas, scikit-learn, maybe TensorFlow/PyTorch if they’re ambitious). Even if they’re not fluent, just showing “working knowledge” reduces employer concerns.\n\n-   **Always highlight transferable skills.** Frame your résumé and interviews around what you can *do* with data (segmentation, predictive models, campaign optimization), not just which software you use.\n\n::: callout-tip\n### 👉 So the bottom line to students would be:\n\nYes, you can be job-ready with just R for many marketing analytics and data science roles. But if you want to maximize opportunities—especially in ML-heavy or tech-company contexts—adding at least s**ome Python competency** will make you more competitive.\n:::\n\n## Marketing Data Scientist Job-Readiness Roadmap\n\n### **Core Analytics & Marketing Knowledge**\n\n-   Be able to **frame business problems as data problems**\n\n-   A/B testing & experimental design (campaign testing, website optimization)\n\n-   Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) / attribution models\n\n-   Customer segmentation & clustering\n\n-   Lifetime value prediction & churn analysis\n\n-   Price elasticity and promotion lift modeling\n\n### **Programming & Tools**\n\n-   Must-Have\n\n    -   **R (strong foundation)**\n\n        -   Data wrangling: `dplyr`, `tidyr`\n\n        -   Visualization: `ggplot2`, `plotly`\n\n        -   Modeling: `caret`, `tidymodels`, `lavaan` (SEM), `forecast`/`prophet`\n\n        -   Reporting: `RMarkdown`, `Shiny`\n\n    -   **SQL**\n\n        -   Querying large marketing/customer databases\n\n        -   Joins, aggregations, window functions\n\n-   Nice-to-Have (to maximize opportunities)\n\n    -   **Python (working knowledge)**\n\n        -   `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn` for predictive modeling\n\n        -   Optional: `tensorflow/pytorch` for deep learning if going ML-heavy\n\n    -   **BI Tools**: Tableau or PowerBI (business-facing dashboards)\n\n### **Math & Stats Foundation**\n\n-   Regression (linear, logistic, regularized)\n\n-   Hypothesis testing, ANOVA, chi-square\n\n-   Bayesian inference (useful for MMM & A/B testing)\n\n-   Time series forecasting\n\n### **Business & Storytelling Skills**\n\n-   Turning statistical outputs into **marketing recommendations**\n\n-   Visualization for non-technical stakeholders\n\n-   Writing **executive-friendly reports** (e.g., “Campaign X lifted ROI by 12%”)\n\n-   Communicating uncertainty and trade-offs\n\n### **Portfolio Project Ideas (Show Employers!)**\n\nEncourage students to **publish on GitHub + LinkedIn**:\n\n1.  **Marketing Mix Model (MMM)** on simulated data — estimate ROI of channels\n\n2.  **Customer Segmentation** with clustering (K-means / hierarchical / mixture models)\n\n3.  **A/B Test Simulation** — show how to design, analyze, and interpret results\n\n4.  **Customer Churn Prediction** — build a classification model from CRM data\n\n5.  **Sentiment Analysis** on customer reviews or social media (Python-friendly add-on)\n\n6.  **Interactive Dashboard** (R Shiny or Tableau) for campaign performance\n\n### **Job Search Positioning**\n\n-   Frame yourself as: **“I use data to optimize marketing decisions and drive ROI.”**\n\n-   Tailor résumé to highlight:\n\n    -   Tools: R, SQL, some Python\n\n    -   Skills: A/B testing, MMM, segmentation, forecasting, churn prediction\n\n    -   Communication: dashboards, storytelling\n\n### Final Advice\n\n-   **Yes, R is enough** to get into analytics-heavy roles.\n\n-   **Python basics** unlock ML/AI-heavy roles (tech firms, ad-tech, recommendation systems).\n\n-   Employers don’t hire tools—they hire **problem solvers who can generate insights from data**.\n\n## What is Positron?\n\n**Positron** is a free, next-generation data science IDE from Posit (formerly RStudio) that supports both **Python and R** natively—it’s designed for polyglot workflows. It’s built on the open-source **Code OSS** (the foundation of VS Code) and brings a modern, extensible environment tailored for data work\n\n**Key features include:**\n\n-   **Variable & Data Frame Explorer**: Explore, filter, sort, and summarize your data interactively\n\n-   **Multi‑Session Console**: Run R and Python code in parallel, each in separate consoles, without modifying your source files\n\n-   **Interpreter & Environment Management**: Easily switch between different R and Python environments\n\n-   **Polished UI & AI Assistance**: Includes a modern editor with support for VSIX extensions and the Positron Assistant for contextual AI-based help\n\n-   **Database Connection Pane**: Built-in support for browsing and querying SQL data sources directly within the IDE\n\n-   **Integrated Data App Workflow**: Launch and debug Shiny, Streamlit, Dash, or FastAPI apps with a single click\n\n### How Does It Compare to RStudio for Data Warehouse Integration?\n\nRStudio remains a highly stable and familiar environment for R work, especially in statistical modeling and reproducible reporting with R Markdown or Quarto. However, when it comes to interfacing with data warehouses—typically SQL-heavy work—Positron offers distinct advantages:\n\n-   **Advantages of Positron:**\n\n    1.  **Built-In SQL Integration**: The Database Connection Pane lets users connect to and query SQL data sources right inside the IDE, making data-access streamlined.\n\n    2.  **Polyglot Workflow**: For teams or students who may use both R and Python for ETL, modeling, or automation, Positron lets them do so in one session—no context-switching needed.\n\n    3.  **Modern, Customizable UI**: Being based on VS Code, Positron supports a wide ecosystem of extensions, customizable layout, and flexible workflows\n\n-   Things to Keep in Mind:\n\n    -   **Active Development**: Positron is still relatively new and under active development. Some features familiar from RStudio—like inline output in Quarto documents, workspace autosave on restart, history pane, and RStudio Add-ins—are not yet fully implemented.\n\n    -   **Learning Curve**: Switching from RStudio may take some onboarding time, especially for users accustomed to its tightly integrated interface\n\n    -   **Foundation**: RStudio continues to be maintained with a focus on stability, especially for R-heavy workflows. Positron is additive, not a replacement\n\n### Judgment Call: Is Positron Better for Data Warehouse Workflows?\n\n**Yes—especially for workflows involving SQL or dual-language environments.** Here’s why:\n\n-   The built-in SQL pane and query tools make accessing warehouse data naturally part of the coding workflow.\n\n-   Students can seamlessly move between R and Python, which many real-world jobs require.\n\n-   The VS Code-based engine makes Positron extensible, customizable, and future-facing.\n\nThat said, if the student is focused primarily on R and relies heavily on RMarkdown, Addins, or a very streamlined R-focused workflow, RStudio may still feel more polished.\n\n## Recommendation for Marketing Data Science Tools\n\n-   **For SQL-heavy, polyglot, or app-deployment workflows**: Experiment with **Positron**. Its features align well with modern data engineering and analytics workflows.\n\n-   **For R-focused, academic, or reproducibility-heavy tasks**: **RStudio** remains excellent and highly reliable—especially for teaching foundations in R.\n\n### What to install (minimum viable setup)\n\n1.  **R in VS Code**\n\n    -   Extension: **“R” (REditorSupport)** — consoles, data viewer, plots pane, workspace browser, debugging, Rmd support. ([Visual Studio Marketplace;](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r&utm_source=chatgpt.com \"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=reditorsupport.r&utm_source=chatgpt.com\")[Visual Studio Code;](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r?utm_source=chatgpt.com\")[GitHub.](https://github.com/REditorSupport/vscode-R?search=1&utm_source=chatgpt.com \"https://github.com/reditorsupport/vscode-r?search=1&utm_source=chatgpt.com\"))\n\n    -   Helpful bits:\n\n        -   `languageserver` for IDE features (autocomplete, linting). ([jozef.io](https://jozef.io/r300-language-server-setup/?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"https://jozef.io/r300-language-server-setup/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\"))\n\n        -   `httpgd` for a great plot viewer (enable “R: Plot: Use httpgd”). Note: currently installed from GitHub. ([Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52284345/how-to-show-r-graph-from-visual-studio-code?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52284345/how-to-show-r-graph-from-visual-studio-code?utm_source=chatgpt.com\"))\n\n2.  **Quarto**\n\n    -   Install Quarto CLI, then VS Code **“Quarto”** extension for render/preview and project workflows (websites/books).\n\n3.  **Python**\n\n    -   Extensions: **Python**, **Pylance**, and **Jupyter** (first-class support; active monthly releases; new dedicated **Python Environments** panel rolling out). ([Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python&utm_source=chatgpt.com \"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=ms-python.python&utm_source=chatgpt.com\"); [Microsoft for Developers+1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-july-2025-release/?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-july-2025-release/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\"); [Visual Studio Magazine](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2025/08/18/dedicated-python-environments-tool-rolls-out-in-vs-code-update.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2025/08/18/dedicated-python-environments-tool-rolls-out-in-vs-code-update.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com\"))\n\n### Connecting to data warehouses (three good paths)\n\n1.  **Pure SQL inside VS Code**\n\n    -   Use **SQLTools** plus the driver for your warehouse (Snowflake, Databricks, Postgres, etc.) to browse schemas and run queries inline.\n\n    -   Examples:\n\n        -   **Snowflake** VS Code extension (SQL + Snowpark integration).\n\n        -   **Databricks** driver for SQLTools (query SQL Warehouses directly).\n\n    -   FYI for Microsoft stacks: Azure Data Studio is being retired in 2026; Microsoft recommends moving to VS Code + SQL extensions. [Microsoft LearnLinks to an external site.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/whats-happening-azure-data-studio?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/whats-happening-azure-data-studio?utm_source=chatgpt.com\")\n\n2.  **R + DBI/odbc from your code**\n\n    -   Use **DBI** with **odbc** (or backend-specific drivers like `RPostgres`, `bigrquery`) and optionally `dbplyr` to write dplyr that translates to SQL.\n\n3.  **C. Python from your code**\n\n    -   Use **SQLAlchemy**, **pyodbc**, **snowflake-snowpark-python**, or **databricks-sql-connector** within VS Code’s Python/Jupyter workflow (extensions above cover environments and notebooks). (General pattern supported by the Python/Jupyter extensions.)\n\n### VS Code vs. Positron vs. RStudio (for your use case)\n\n-   **VS Code**: Most mature **polyglot** environment today; deep SQL tooling; constant releases; huge extension ecosystem (including Quarto). Great when students mix R, Python, and warehouse SQL.\n\n-   **Positron**: Promising R+Python IDE from Posit with data/variable explorer and SQL pane, but still maturing; some RStudio niceties aren’t fully there yet. If you need “ready today” for warehousing, VS Code wins on stability and breadth. (Context: Positron pages highlight active development and gaps vs RStudio.)\n\n-   **RStudio**: Still superb for **R-first** teaching (R Markdown/Quarto, tidyverse, Shiny) but not as strong for multi-language + warehouse dev as VS Code’s ecosystem.\n\n### Bottom line\n\nIf Positron feels a bit early for you right now, **VS Code is the best “bridge”**: rock-solid for **R + Quarto + Python** and excellent for **data-warehouse** workflows via SQLTools/warehouse extensions or via DBI/odbc inside your code. It’s a great environment to standardize on for your cohort this year.\n\n# **Marketing Analysts vs. Marketing Data Scientists: Comparisons**\n\n## Career Preparations for Marketing Analytics
