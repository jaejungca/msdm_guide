To learn about career and job roles, refer to [Typical Job Roles in Digital Marketing](career_outlook_salary_digital_marketing.qmd#content-creative-roles) section of the Careers page and come back here to proceed.\n:::\n\n![MS in Digital Marketing Program Curriculum](images/Curriculum_Emphasis.png){fig-alt=\"It is a screenshot of the MS in Digital Marketing Program Curriculum\"}\n\nFor the [Curriculum Overview](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/new-msdm-curriculum.shtml), you may visit the official web page for the curriculum, but the implication is that there are basically three curriculum options for you. Select the one that would be best match for your aspired career path. In Step 4, you will be provided with the factors to consider when choosing degree emphasis.\n\n-   **Three Curriculum (Degree Emphasis) Options**\n\n    1.  [**Digital Marketing Strategy (DMS) Emphasis**](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/msdm-digital-marketing-strategy-emphasis.shtml)\n\n        -   This emphasis is best suited for students who want to have a career in **Content & Creative Roles,** such as Content Writer/SEO Writer and Social Media Manager.\n        -   For **Major Electives: *Emphasis Recommended***, choose all 10 units under DMS Emphasis: IBM 6100, IBM 6150, IBM 6250, and IBM 6300\n        -   For **Major Electives: *Emphasis Other***, choose IBM 6450 and one more course from any other graduate-level IBM-prefix courses or GBA 5140.\n\n    2.  [**Marketing Analytics (MA) Emphasis**](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/msdm-marketing-analytics-emphasis.shtml)\n\n        -   This emphasis is best suited for students who want to have a career in **Marketing Data Specialist Roles** such as Marketing Data Scientist, Marketing Engineer, and Marketing Data Analyst.\n        -   For **Major Electives: *Emphasis Recommended***, choose all 10 units under MA Emphasis: IBM 6520, IBM 6530, IBM 6540, and IBM 6600\n        -   For **Major Electives: *Emphasis Other***, choose IBM 6700 and one more course from any other graduate-level IBM-prefix courses or GBA 6520.\n\n    3.  **Balanced/Customized**\n\n        -   This track is best suited for students who want to have a career in various **Technical & Performance Roles** such as *SEO Specialist*, *PPC Specialist*, *Email Marketing Specialist*, *Marketing data analyst*, except for Marketing Data Scientist or Marketing Engineer, for which MA Emphasis will be a better fit.\n\n        -   If you want to be **well-rounded** so that you can be prepared for various digital marketing roles across content, performance, and analytics, **balanced option** will be ideal.\n\n        -   This option allows you to choose courses from both emphases to **tailor** to your **career needs** and your **current set of skills and knowledge**. For example, if you have been working as a social media coordinator for an organization and want to keep pursuing your career on **Content and Creative Roles**, you should have pretty good working knowledge about social media platforms and strategy. In that case, there is no reason to take IBM 6250 (Social Media Marketing); instead, you can take any other remaining electives (from MA Emphasis) to expand your skills and knowledge.\n\n## **Step 3: Know Curriculum Completion Roadmap Options** {#curriculum-roadmaps}\n\nEach course is offered **only once per year** in a designated term due to prerequisites and scheduling constraints.\n\n### 2-Year Completion Roadmap\n\n-   **Availability:**\n\n    -   Available for both Fall and Spring admissions\n\n    -   Spring admits may complete in 1.5 years\n\n-   [Digital Marketing Strategy Emphasis](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/msdm-digital-marketing-strategy-emphasis.shtml)\n\n-   [Marketing Analytics Emphasis](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/msdm-marketing-analytics-emphasis.shtml)\n\n### 1-Year Completion Roadmap\n\n-   **Availability:**\n\n    -   Available ***only for fall admission***.\n\n    -   **Not available for spring admission**.\n\n-   [Digital Marketing Strategy Emphasis](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/msdm-digital-marketing-strategy-emphasis.shtml)\n\n-   [Marketing Analytics Emphasis](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/msdm-marketing-analytics-emphasis.shtml)\n\n### **Spring Admits**\n\nStudents starting in Spring can finish in **2 years** or **1.5 years**.\n\nIn the first fall semester, Spring admits can take:\n\n-   IBM 6010 (Make-up)\n\n-   IBM 5910 (Make-up)\n\n-   IBM 6500 (Required for second fall)\n\n-   IBM 6200 (Required for second fall)\n\n## **Step 4: Consider These Factors When Choosing Degree Emphasis** {#factors-to-consider-when-choosing-degree-emphasis}\n\nChoosing between **Digital Marketing Strategy, Marketing Analytics,** and **Balanced/Mixed Option** requires careful thought. Below are key factors to guide your decision.\n\n### Post-Graduation Career Goal\n\nEntry to mid-level career jobs in Digital Marketing can be grouped under three big categories before they move into leadership roles. For details about the taxonomy, refer to [Typical Job Roles in Digital Marketing](career_outlook_salary_digital_marketing.qmd#typical-job-titles).\n\n1.  Content & Creative Roles\n\n2.  Techncial & Performance Roles\n\n3.  Analytics (Marketing Data Specialist) Roles\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Recommendations\n\nBased on the immediate career goal right after graduation, my recommendation for Degree Emphasis would be different as follows:\n\n-   If you prefer to take **Content & Creative Roles,** such as content writer/SEO writer, copy writer, social media manager, and graphics/visual designer –\\> choose **Digital Marketing Strategy Emphasis**.\n\n-   If you prefer to take **Technical & Performance Roles**, such as SEO Specialist, PPC Specialist, and Email Marketing Specialist –\\> choose **Balanced/Mixed Option**.\n\n-   If you prefer to take **Analytics (Marketing Data Specialist) Roles**, such as Marketing Data Analytist, Marketing Data Scientist, and Marketing Data Engineer –\\> choose **Marketing Analytics Emphasis**.\n:::\n\n### Upward mobility\n\nMany students pursue a master’s degree to advance their careers.\n\n> **Note on career stage:** Strategy and leadership roles are often **mid-career+**. Many MSDM graduates start in specialist roles (content, performance, or analytics) and move into strategy/leadership after building execution + measurement + cross-functional experience. The pathway for the students would be like this:\n>\n> -   **Entry-level:** Coordinator, Specialist, Analyst (Jr.)\n>\n> -   **Mid-level:** Manager, Strategist, Senior Specialist/Analyst\n>\n> -   **Senior:** Lead, Director, Head of Growth/Marketing\n\nA common pattern is:\n\n-   Students with digital marketing work experience often reach a ceiling due to **limited analytics skills**.\n\n-   Higher-level roles (e.g., Director, VP of Digital Marketing) generally require **balanced knowledge** of strategy *and* analytics.\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Recommendations:\n\n-   If you already have several years of digital marketing experience → Consider **Marketing Analytics** courses.\n\n-   If you handle data but lack confidence in statistics or machine learning → Strengthen your **Marketing Analytics** foundation.\n:::\n\n### Pay (ROI) Considerations\n\nSalaries in digital marketing vary by role type (creative vs. performance vs. analytics vs. strategy/leadership), location, and experience level. The figures below are **U.S. national estimates** shown as:\n\n-   **Blended average** = mean of **ZipRecruiter + Glassdoor + Salary.com**\n\n-   **Typical range + top earners** = ZipRecruiter 25th–75th percentile, plus 90th percentile (where available)\n\n> **Tip for students:** Use these as directional benchmarks, then check “in your area” estimates and real internship/job postings in your target city.\n\nBelow are the salary information as of **January 6, 2026**.\n\n1.  **Content & Creative Roles**\n\n    -   **Content Writer / SEO Writer** — **Blended avg:** **\\~\\$80K** (ZipRecruiter \\$84,151; Glassdoor \\~\\$84K; Salary.com \\$72,912).\\\n        ZipRecruiter typical **\\$49K–\\$96.5K**; top earners **\\$186K**.\n\n    -   **Copywriter** — **Blended avg:** **\\~\\$79K** (ZipRecruiter \\$76,412; Glassdoor \\$86,199; Salary.com \\$73,481).\\\n        ZipRecruiter typical **\\$58K–\\$86.5K**; top earners **\\$121.5K**.\n\n    -   **Social Media Manager** — **Blended avg:** **\\~\\$83K** (ZipRecruiter \\$64,845; Glassdoor \\$71,474; Salary.com \\$112,750).\\\n        ZipRecruiter typical **\\$47.5K–\\$76.5K**; top earners **\\$95.5K**.\\\n        *Note:* Salary.com’s figure is much higher here, which is why the blended average rises.

In that case, consider choosing the **Marketing Analytics emphasis**.\n:::\n\n### Job Prospects (Domestic vs. International Students)\n\n#### Domestic Students\n\nGenerally secure employment after completing the program, if flexible with pay.\n\n#### International Students\n\nFace different hiring realities:\n\n-   Companies must demonstrate they cannot fill the job with a U.S. citizen to sponsor an H-1B Visa.\n\n-   U.S. candidates are plentiful in creative and implementation roles (social media, digital marketing execution).\n\n-   Fewer U.S. candidates pursue STEM-related analytics roles, making international students **more competitive in jobs in Analytics Roles and Technical & Performance Roles**.\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Bottom line:\n\nIn general, international students seeking U.S. employment are often better off choosing the **Marketing Analytics** emphasis or the **Balanced/Mixed** option.\n:::\n\n#### Strategic Consideration\n\nYou are not required to follow the recommended elective lists exactly. Choose the courses that best strengthen your skills and make you a well-rounded professional. We support a customized curriculum within the allowed electives. This makes the **Balanced/Mixed Option** attractive.\n\n## **Step 5: Consider These Factors in Choosing a 1-Year vs. 2-Year Roadmap** {#choosing-a-1-year-vs.-2-year-roadmap}\n\nAs you prepare for your curriculum contract and make an appointment to meet with me, I want to provide you with some information to consider in your decision to choose a 1-year vs. a 2-year completion roadmap. \n\n::: panel-tabset\n### 2-Year Completion Roadmap:\n\n**Recommended if any of the following are true**\n\n-   You are working while in the program.\n\n-   You have limited preparation in math, statistics, or programming.\n\n-   You want more time to strengthen English skills.\n\n-   You are an international student who needs time to acclimate.\n\n-   You want to participate fully in extracurricular activities (club, competitions, workshops, symposiums).\n\n### 1-Year Completion Roadmap:\n\n**Doable if most of the following apply**\n\n-   You do not have a job or family responsibilities.\n\n-   You have taken college algebra, calculus, and at least one statistics course.\n\n-   You earned a BS in Business Administration from an AACSB-accredited university.\n\n-   You are an international student planning to return home immediately after graduation and want to minimize cost.\n:::\n\n-   **Financial Impact: 1-Year vs. 2-Year Roadmap**\n\n    Tuition is the same overall, but **auxiliary fees differ**:\n\n    -   Auxiliary fees: \\~\\$850/semester, \\~\\$400/summer\n\n    -   Two-year students pay more total auxiliary fees\n\n    -   One-year students save approximately **\\$2,100**\n\n## **Step 6: Plan Your Roadmap with Worksheets** {#plan-your-roadmap-with-worksheets}\n\n> Use one of the ***worksheets*** below to plan your curriculum roadmap for the duration of your study. As you plan, be sure to follow the [Course Registration Instructions](course_registration.qmd#before-you-register-what-every-msdm-student-should-know).\n>\n> For more information about the **curriculum completion roadmap**, see the [Curriculum Roadmap Section](#curriculum-new-curriculum).\n\n### Fall-Admitted Students\n\n-   [Curriculum completion roadmap worksheet for students admitted in the fall semester](https://livecsupomona-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/jmjung_cpp_edu/IQAAdQYw-V2KToRGYKBD0jkxAZgBi7HKLF82uk1DQ2OxqL4?e=5hZP3M)\n\n    -   Two worksheet options (2-year and 1-year tracks) are included in the file.\n\n### Spring-Admitted Students\n\n-   [Curriculum completion roadmap worksheet for students admitted in the spring semester](https://livecsupomona-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/jmjung_cpp_edu/IQA_iDDMJpwOSKS125__4NIyAZVU8Vt2GJaUWYXo6xEo9JA?e=D5PyIN)\n\n    -   Two worksheet options (2-year and 1.5-year tracks) are included in the file.\n\n## **Step 7: Submit the Curriculum Contract Form and Curriculum Worksheet to Your Advisor** {#submit-curriculum-contract-and-roadmap-worksheet}\n\n1.  Fill out the ***Curriculum Contract form*** introduced in [the Start Filling out Curriculum Contract Form section](#appointment-for-curriculum-contract). When you click the submit button on the Google form, your advisor will receive the form. At the same time, you will receive a copy for your reference.\n\n2.  In the form, you will be asked to fill out a ***Curriculum Roadmap Worksheet*** (Excel spreadsheet) and send it to the academic advisor ([Dr. Jae Jung](https://www.cpp.edu/faculty/jmjung/index.shtml)). To do so, download the file, save it with your first name_last name in front of the file name, choose the correct worksheet for your roadmap, fill out the worksheet, and email the completed worksheet to the academic advisor.\n\n3.  Once I receive an email with your Curriculum Roadmap Worksheet, I will review it and ***give you feedback***.\n\n4.  Your Curriculum Worksheet will be placed under your folder. If you ever needs to change curriculum later, contact me. I will be happy to discuss with you and assisting you in finding best courses for your career path.\n\n## **Step 8: Register for Courses** {#register-for-courses}\n\n1.

To learn about career and job roles, refer to [Typical Job Roles in Digital Marketing](career_outlook_salary_digital_marketing.qmd#content-creative-roles) section of the Careers page and come back here to proceed.\n:::\n\n![MS in Digital Marketing Program Curriculum](images/Curriculum_Emphasis.png){fig-alt=\"It is a screenshot of the MS in Digital Marketing Program Curriculum\"}\n\nFor the [Curriculum Overview](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/new-msdm-curriculum.shtml), you may visit the official web page for the curriculum, but the implication is that there are basically three curriculum options for you. Select the one that would be best match for your aspired career path. In Step 4, you will be provided with the factors to consider when choosing degree emphasis.\n\n-   **Three Curriculum (Degree Emphasis) Options**\n\n    1.  [**Digital Marketing Strategy (DMS) Emphasis**](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/msdm-digital-marketing-strategy-emphasis.shtml)\n\n        -   This emphasis is best suited for students who want to have a career in **Content & Creative Roles,** such as Content Writer/SEO Writer and Social Media Manager.\n        -   For **Major Electives: *Emphasis Recommended***, choose all 10 units under DMS Emphasis: IBM 6100, IBM 6150, IBM 6250, and IBM 6300\n        -   For **Major Electives: *Emphasis Other***, choose IBM 6450 and one more course from any other graduate-level IBM-prefix courses or GBA 5140.\n\n    2.  [**Marketing Analytics (MA) Emphasis**](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/msdm-marketing-analytics-emphasis.shtml)\n\n        -   This emphasis is best suited for students who want to have a career in **Marketing Data Specialist Roles** such as Marketing Data Scientist, Marketing Engineer, and Marketing Data Analyst.\n        -   For **Major Electives: *Emphasis Recommended***, choose all 10 units under MA Emphasis: IBM 6520, IBM 6530, IBM 6540, and IBM 6600\n        -   For **Major Electives: *Emphasis Other***, choose IBM 6700 and one more course from any other graduate-level IBM-prefix courses or GBA 6520.\n\n    3.  **Balanced/Customized**\n\n        -   This track is best suited for students who want to have a career in various **Technical & Performance Roles** such as *SEO Specialist*, *PPC Specialist*, *Email Marketing Specialist*, *Marketing data analyst*, except for Marketing Data Scientist or Marketing Engineer, for which MA Emphasis will be a better fit.\n\n        -   If you want to be **well-rounded** so that you can be prepared for various digital marketing roles across content, performance, and analytics, **balanced option** will be ideal.\n\n        -   This option allows you to choose courses from both emphases to **tailor** to your **career needs** and your **current set of skills and knowledge**. For example, if you have been working as a social media coordinator for an organization and want to keep pursuing your career on **Content and Creative Roles**, you should have pretty good working knowledge about social media platforms and strategy. In that case, there is no reason to take IBM 6250 (Social Media Marketing); instead, you can take any other remaining electives (from MA Emphasis) to expand your skills and knowledge.\n\n## **Step 3: Know Curriculum Completion Roadmap Options** {#curriculum-roadmaps}\n\nEach course is offered **only once per year** in a designated term due to prerequisites and scheduling constraints.\n\n### 2-Year Completion Roadmap\n\n-   **Availability:**\n\n    -   Available for both Fall and Spring admissions\n\n    -   Spring admits may complete in 1.5 years\n\n-   [Digital Marketing Strategy Emphasis](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/msdm-digital-marketing-strategy-emphasis.shtml)\n\n-   [Marketing Analytics Emphasis](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/msdm-marketing-analytics-emphasis.shtml)\n\n### 1-Year Completion Roadmap\n\n-   **Availability:**\n\n    -   Available ***only for fall admission***.\n\n    -   **Not available for spring admission**.\n\n-   [Digital Marketing Strategy Emphasis](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/msdm-digital-marketing-strategy-emphasis.shtml)\n\n-   [Marketing Analytics Emphasis](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/msdm-marketing-analytics-emphasis.shtml)\n\n### **Spring Admits**\n\nStudents starting in Spring can finish in **2 years** or **1.5 years**.\n\nIn the first fall semester, Spring admits can take:\n\n-   IBM 6010 (Make-up)\n\n-   IBM 5910 (Make-up)\n\n-   IBM 6500 (Required for second fall)\n\n-   IBM 6200 (Required for second fall)\n\n## **Step 4: Consider These Factors When Choosing Degree Emphasis** {#factors-to-consider-when-choosing-degree-emphasis}\n\nChoosing between **Digital Marketing Strategy, Marketing Analytics,** and **Balanced/Mixed Option** requires careful thought. Below are key factors to guide your decision.\n\n### Post-Graduation Career Goal\n\nEntry to mid-level career jobs in Digital Marketing can be grouped under three big categories before they move into leadership roles. For details about the taxonomy, refer to [Typical Job Roles in Digital Marketing](career_outlook_salary_digital_marketing.qmd#typical-job-titles).\n\n1.  Content & Creative Roles\n\n2.  Techncial & Performance Roles\n\n3.  Analytics (Marketing Data Specialist) Roles\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Recommendations\n\nBased on the immediate career goal right after graduation, my recommendation for Degree Emphasis would be different as follows:\n\n-   If you prefer to take **Content & Creative Roles,** such as content writer/SEO writer, copy writer, social media manager, and graphics/visual designer –\\> choose **Digital Marketing Strategy Emphasis**.\n\n-   If you prefer to take **Technical & Performance Roles**, such as SEO Specialist, PPC Specialist, and Email Marketing Specialist –\\> choose **Balanced/Mixed Option**.\n\n-   If you prefer to take **Analytics (Marketing Data Specialist) Roles**, such as Marketing Data Analytist, Marketing Data Scientist, and Marketing Data Engineer –\\> choose **Marketing Analytics Emphasis**.\n:::\n\n### Upward mobility\n\nMany students pursue a master’s degree to advance their careers.\n\n> **Note on career stage:** Strategy and leadership roles are often **mid-career+**. Many MSDM graduates start in specialist roles (content, performance, or analytics) and move into strategy/leadership after building execution + measurement + cross-functional experience. The pathway for the students would be like this:\n>\n> -   **Entry-level:** Coordinator, Specialist, Analyst (Jr.)\n>\n> -   **Mid-level:** Manager, Strategist, Senior Specialist/Analyst\n>\n> -   **Senior:** Lead, Director, Head of Growth/Marketing\n\nA common pattern is:\n\n-   Students with digital marketing work experience often reach a ceiling due to **limited analytics skills**.\n\n-   Higher-level roles (e.g., Director, VP of Digital Marketing) generally require **balanced knowledge** of strategy *and* analytics.\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Recommendations:\n\n-   If you already have several years of digital marketing experience → Consider **Marketing Analytics** courses.\n\n-   If you handle data but lack confidence in statistics or machine learning → Strengthen your **Marketing Analytics** foundation.\n:::\n\n### Pay (ROI) Considerations\n\nSalaries in digital marketing vary by role type (creative vs. performance vs. analytics vs. strategy/leadership), location, and experience level. The figures below are **U.S. national estimates** shown as:\n\n-   **Blended average** = mean of **ZipRecruiter + Glassdoor + Salary.com**\n\n-   **Typical range + top earners** = ZipRecruiter 25th–75th percentile, plus 90th percentile (where available)\n\n> **Tip for students:** Use these as directional benchmarks, then check “in your area” estimates and real internship/job postings in your target city.\n\nBelow are the salary information as of **January 6, 2026**.\n\n1.  **Content & Creative Roles**\n\n    -   **Content Writer / SEO Writer** — **Blended avg:** **\\~\\$80K** (ZipRecruiter \\$84,151; Glassdoor \\~\\$84K; Salary.com \\$72,912).\\\n        ZipRecruiter typical **\\$49K–\\$96.5K**; top earners **\\$186K**.\n\n    -   **Copywriter** — **Blended avg:** **\\~\\$79K** (ZipRecruiter \\$76,412; Glassdoor \\$86,199; Salary.com \\$73,481).\\\n        ZipRecruiter typical **\\$58K–\\$86.5K**; top earners **\\$121.5K**.\n\n    -   **Social Media Manager** — **Blended avg:** **\\~\\$83K** (ZipRecruiter \\$64,845; Glassdoor \\$71,474; Salary.com \\$112,750).\\\n        ZipRecruiter typical **\\$47.5K–\\$76.5K**; top earners **\\$95.5K**.\\\n        *Note:* Salary.com’s figure is much higher here, which is why the blended average rises.

In that case, consider choosing the **Marketing Analytics emphasis**.\n:::\n\n### Job Prospects (Domestic vs. International Students)\n\n#### Domestic Students\n\nGenerally secure employment after completing the program, if flexible with pay.\n\n#### International Students\n\nFace different hiring realities:\n\n-   Companies must demonstrate they cannot fill the job with a U.S. citizen to sponsor an H-1B Visa.\n\n-   U.S. candidates are plentiful in creative and implementation roles (social media, digital marketing execution).\n\n-   Fewer U.S. candidates pursue STEM-related analytics roles, making international students **more competitive in jobs in Analytics Roles and Technical & Performance Roles**.\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Bottom line:\n\nIn general, international students seeking U.S. employment are often better off choosing the **Marketing Analytics** emphasis or the **Balanced/Mixed** option.\n:::\n\n#### Strategic Consideration\n\nYou are not required to follow the recommended elective lists exactly. Choose the courses that best strengthen your skills and make you a well-rounded professional. We support a customized curriculum within the allowed electives. This makes the **Balanced/Mixed Option** attractive.\n\n## **Step 5: Consider These Factors in Choosing a 1-Year vs. 2-Year Roadmap** {#choosing-a-1-year-vs.-2-year-roadmap}\n\nAs you prepare for your curriculum contract and make an appointment to meet with me, I want to provide you with some information to consider in your decision to choose a 1-year vs. a 2-year completion roadmap. \n\n::: panel-tabset\n### 2-Year Completion Roadmap:\n\n**Recommended if any of the following are true**\n\n-   You are working while in the program.\n\n-   You have limited preparation in math, statistics, or programming.\n\n-   You want more time to strengthen English skills.\n\n-   You are an international student who needs time to acclimate.\n\n-   You want to participate fully in extracurricular activities (club, competitions, workshops, symposiums).\n\n### 1-Year Completion Roadmap:\n\n**Doable if most of the following apply**\n\n-   You do not have a job or family responsibilities.\n\n-   You have taken college algebra, calculus, and at least one statistics course.\n\n-   You earned a BS in Business Administration from an AACSB-accredited university.\n\n-   You are an international student planning to return home immediately after graduation and want to minimize cost.\n:::\n\n-   **Financial Impact: 1-Year vs. 2-Year Roadmap**\n\n    Tuition is the same overall, but **auxiliary fees differ**:\n\n    -   Auxiliary fees: \\~\\$850/semester, \\~\\$400/summer\n\n    -   Two-year students pay more total auxiliary fees\n\n    -   One-year students save approximately **\\$2,100**\n\n## **Step 6: Plan Your Roadmap with Worksheets** {#plan-your-roadmap-with-worksheets}\n\n> Use one of the ***worksheets*** below to plan your curriculum roadmap for the duration of your study.
