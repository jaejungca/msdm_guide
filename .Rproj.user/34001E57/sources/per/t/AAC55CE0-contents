::: {.callout-tip title="Tips:"}
> 1.  **If you are new to the MSDM program, schedule an advising meeting with your faculty advisor and submit a Curriculum Contract.**\
>     In this contract, you will select your [curriculum emphasis]{.underline} (Digital Marketing Strategy, Marketing Analytics, or Balanced) and your [completion roadmap]{.underline} (1-year or 2-year).
>
> 2.  **Before registering each semester, refer to the signed Curriculum Contract you submitted to your academic advisor.**\
>     This will guide your course sequencing and ensure timely progress toward graduation.
>
> 3.  **The course listings on this page reflect the 2-year completion roadmap for students who began the program in Fall 2025 or later.**
>
> 4.  **Students who started the program before Fall 2025 should refer to the curriculum for their cohort:** [**MSDM Curriculum Prior to Fall 2025**](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/msdm-curriculum.shtml)
>
> 5.  **Students following the 1-year completion roadmap should enroll in a consolidated list of Year 1 and Year 2 courses each semester.**\
>     This accelerated pathway requires careful scheduling to meet all requirements within one academic year.
>
> 6.  **All MSDM courses are offered only once per academic year.**\
>     If you miss a course in its designated term, you will need to wait until the same term the following year to take it.
>
> 7.  **If you are in the first year of the 2-year completion roadmap, register only for first-year courses offered in that semester.**\
>     Second-year courses for that semester should be taken during your second year.
