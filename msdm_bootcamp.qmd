[**Introduction**]{style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold; font-size: 30px;"}

This Boot Camp is designed to help you hit the ground running in your first semester of the MSDM program.

You’ll benefit the most if **either** of the following is true:

-   You’re **not yet comfortable with advanced Excel features** (e.g., PivotTables/PivotCharts, XLOOKUP or INDEX-MATCH, basic data cleaning and charting).
-   You **haven’t taken a statistics course that used R** (or it’s been a while and you’d like a refresher).

### Who should do this?

If you checked one (or both) of the items above, complete the first two **Excel** tutorials and the first **R** tutorial below *before* the semester begins. These are free through LinkedIn Learning when you sign in via [**MyCPP**](https://my.cpp.edu/).
:::

::: callout-tip
### How to prioritize your time if you don't have enough time:

1.  Start with **Excel Skills** (tutorials #1–2).

2.  Do **R Programming and Statistics** (tutorial #1).

3.  If time allows, explore the additional tutorials for deeper practice.
:::

## **Spreadsheet Skills**

You don't need to finish them all, but try to finish the first two tutorials at LinkedIn Learning, which you can use for free of charge when you log into [MyCPP](https://my.cpp.edu/) at Cal Poly Pomona.

1.  [Excel Essential Training (Microsoft 365)](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/excel-essential-training-microsoft-365-2022/what-is-excel-used-for?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlearningCollection%3A6562397415280914433&resume=false&u=56973593) 

2.  [Excel PivotTables: Mastering PivotTables and PivotCharts](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/excel-pivottables-mastering-pivottables-and-pivotcharts/part-1-introduction?u=56973593) 

3.  [Excel: Advanced Formulas and Functions](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/excel-advanced-formulas-and-functions-22037565?u=56973593) 

## **R Programming and Statistics**

If your undergraduate majors didn't require you to take statistics, then you should consider taking the following Boot Camp materials. You will be exposed to not only statistics but also R and RStudio, the primary coding based tool you will use in the MSDM Program. There is a quite steep learning curve in any programming language. Thus, you are strongly recommended to learn some basics before your first semester.

1.  [R for Data Science: Analysis and Visualization](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/r-for-data-science-analysis-and-visualization?u=56973593) 

2.  [Complete Guide to R: Wrangling, Visualizing, and Modeling Data](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/complete-guide-to-r-wrangling-visualizing-and-modeling-data?u=56973593)
