## **Before You Register: What Every MSDM Student Should Know**

::: {.callout-tip title="Tips:"}
1.  **If you are new to the MSDM program, you must submit a [Curriculum Contract Form](curriculum_contract.qmd#appointment-for-curriculum-contract). Consider scheduling an advising meeting with your academic advisor**[^1] **if you need help.**\
    In this contract, you will select your [Degree Emphasis]{.underline} (Digital Marketing Strategy, Marketing Analytics, or Balanced/Customized) and your [Completion Roadmap Worksheet]{.underline}. Failure to submit the curriculum contract will lead to an academic hold placed on your account, which will prevent you from registering in future courses.

2.  **Before registering each semester, refer to the [Curriculum Completion Roadmap Worksheet]{.underline} you submitted to your academic advisor.**\
    This will guide your course sequencing and ensure timely progress toward graduation.

3.  **If you are in the first year of the 2-year completion roadmap, register only for first-year courses offered in that semester.**\
    Second-year courses for that semester should be taken during your second year.

4.  **Students following the 1.5-year completion roadmap should register only for the first-year courses offered in that semester except for their first fall semester when they should take all required courses for both first and second fall semesters.**\
    Second-year courses for that semester should be taken during your second year except for the fall semester.

5.  **Students following the 1-year completion roadmap should enroll in a consolidated list of Year 1 and Year 2 courses for both semesters.**\
    This accelerated pathway requires careful scheduling to meet all requirements within one academic year.

6.  **The course listings on this page reflect the 2-year completion roadmap for students who began the program in Fall 2025 or later.**

7.  **Students who started the program before Fall 2025 should refer to the curriculum for their cohort:** [**MSDM Curriculum Prior to Fall 2025**](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/msdm-curriculum.shtml)

8.  **All MSDM courses are offered only once per academic year.**\
    If you miss a course in its designated term, you will need to wait until the same term the following year to take it.

9.  **If the course is full, do not panic. Contact the program director (Dr. Jung).**\
    If the course is full, it won't show up in your schedule unless you chose all courses (closed and open). By default, only open courses will show up. The program director and the CPGE staff (Jennifer Cousens) can assist you. Never choose a different course just because the course is full. We know you need to take the class to fulfill your contract, so we will do our best to help you.

[^1]: Program director (Dr. Jung) is your academic advisor.

## **Boot Camp** {#boot-camp}

::: callout-important
Because our students come from diverse educational backgrounds, we offer a Boot Camp designed to build essential readiness skills for the program. It provides foundational spreadsheet skills, an introduction to R programming, and basic statistical concepts that students should know before—or during—their first semester (e.g., spring semester for spring cohort group). All courses are free and available online through MyCPP.

-   [**MSDM Boot Camp**](msdm_bootcamp.qmd)
:::

## **Year 1, Fall**

::: {.callout-note title="Fall Cohort Group"}
-   If you are a fall cohort group, make sure you know the materials on [**MSDM Boot Camp**](#boot-camp).

-   Please do not enroll in the courses not listed here unless you are on a 1-year completion roadmap, as other courses are the ones reserved for your second fall semester.
:::

### Core Courses

-   IBM 5910 - Strategic Data Wrangling and Visualization (3)[^2]

-   IBM 6010 - Digital Marketing (3)

[^2]: In this course, you may learn various BI tools, but R will be main tool for data wranging and visualization, report generation, and publication, emphasizing reproducible document. As you deal with visualizing data, you will also be taught some basic statistics concept such as probability, descriptive statistics, and hypothesis testing. If you have taken a statistics course in your undergraduate program, this course may give you sufficient knowledge. However, if you want a greater depth of knowledge, you are welcome to take GBA 5140 as an elective.

### Electives

-   GBA 5140 - Statistics Essentials (3)[^3]

    -   Eligible for Emphasis Other category for DMS Emphasis
    -   Eligible for Emphasis Other category for MA Emphasis

[^3]: GBA 5140 is a service course offered by Technology and Operatoins Management (TOM) Department for graduate students in SGSB Programs and is similar to its undergraduate course, TOM 3020 (Statistical Foundations for Business Analytics). If you have taken a college-level statistics course in your undergraduate program, you don't need to take this course, as IBM 5190 will cover some basic essential statistical concepts (e.g., descriptive statistics, test of hypothesis, etc.). If you have never taken a statistics course, however, the choice may depend on your aspired [**career roles**](career_outlook_salary_digital_marketing.qmd#typical-job-titles). If you want to pursue **Content & Creative Roles or technology & Performance Roles**, IBM 5190 may be good enough and you don't need to take GBA 5140. On the other hand, If you want to pursue a **data and analytics roles**, you will want to take the course, as strong statistical background would be necessary.

## **Year 1, Spring**

-   If you are a spring cohort group, make sure you know the materials on [**MSDM Boot Camp**](#boot-camp).
