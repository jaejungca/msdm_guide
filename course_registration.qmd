## **Before You Register: What Every MSDM Student Should Know**

::: {.callout-tip title="Tips:"}
1.  **If you are new to the MSDM program, you must submit a [Curriculum Contract Form](curriculum_contract.qmd#appointment-for-curriculum-contract). Consider scheduling an advising meeting with your academic advisor**[^1] **if you need help.**\
    In this contract, you will select your [Degree Emphasis]{.underline} (Digital Marketing Strategy, Marketing Analytics, or Balanced/Customized) and your [Completion Roadmap Worksheet]{.underline}. Failure to submit the curriculum contract will lead to an academic hold placed on your account, which will prevent you from registering in future courses.

2.  **Before registering each semester, refer to the [Curriculum Completion Roadmap Worksheet]{.underline} you submitted to your academic advisor.**\
    This will guide your course sequencing and ensure timely progress toward graduation.

3.  **If you are in the first year of the 2-year completion roadmap, register only for first-year courses offered in that semester.**\
    Second-year courses for that semester should be taken during your second year.

4.  **Students following the 1.5-year completion roadmap should register only for the first-year courses offered in that semester except for their first fall semester when they should take all required courses for both first and second fall semesters.**\
    Second-year courses for that semester should be taken during your second year except for the fall semester.

5.  **Students following the 1-year completion roadmap should enroll in a consolidated list of Year 1 and Year 2 courses for both semesters.**\
    This accelerated pathway requires careful scheduling to meet all requirements within one academic year.

6.  **The course listings on this page reflect the 2-year completion roadmap for students who began the program in Fall 2025 or later.**

7.  **Students who started the program before Fall 2025 should refer to the curriculum for their cohort:** [**MSDM Curriculum Prior to Fall 2025**](https://www.cpp.edu/cba/sgsb/curriculum/msdm-curriculum.shtml)

8.  **All MSDM courses are offered only once per academic year.**\
    If you miss a course in its designated term, you will need to wait until the same term the following year to take it.

9.  **If the course is full, do not panic. Contact the program director (Dr. Jung).**\
    If the course is full, it won't show up in your schedule unless you chose all courses (closed and open). By default, only open courses will show up. The program director and the CPGE staff (Jennifer Cousens) can assist you. Never choose a different course just because the course is full. We know you need to take the class to fulfill your contract, so we will do our best to help you.

## **Boot Camp**

::: callout-important
Because our students come from diverse educational backgrounds, we offer a Boot Camp designed to build essential readiness skills for the program. It provides foundational spreadsheet skills, an introduction to R programming, and basic statistical concepts that students should know before—or during—their first semester (e.g., spring semester for spring cohort group). All courses are free and available online through MyCPP.
